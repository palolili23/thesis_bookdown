## Abstract

Several exposures that affect dementia risk also affect mortality risk. This has led to counterintuitive findings, where some exposures seem to be protective for dementia. Given that bias cannot be defined or assessed if the causal question is not explicitly specified, we illustrate how to conceptualize causal questions when death acts as a competing event, such as the “controlled direct effect” and the “total effect”. We describe how to frame these questions, specify the assumptions related to identification and discuss how to answer both questions with traditional analytic approaches. To illustrate concepts, we present a hypothetical randomized trial on smoking cessation in late-midlife, and emulate such a trial using observational data from the Rotterdam Study. We estimated a total effect of smoking cessation (compared to continued smoking) on 20-year dementia risk of 2.1 (95%CI: -0.1, 4.2) percentage points and a controlled direct effect of smoking cessation on 20-year dementia risk had death been fully prevented of -1.9 (-5.1, 1.4) percentage points. Our study highlights how different causal contrasts can result in different estimates, here going in opposite directions. Having a clear definition of the causal contrast and transparent and explicit assumptions are essential to interpreting results and understanding potential bias.

## Introduction

Much research on dementia etiology focuses on understanding the role of biological factors in the pathophysiological process, and the impact of modifiable factors that could prevent or delay the onset of the disease[@lancet2020]. As such, the field is often interested in causal questions. However, proper causal inference in dementia research faces many methodological and substantive challenges[@power2015]. One of these challenges, which arises even in randomized trials, is that individuals at risk of dementia may die of other causes prior to its onset. In this setting, death is a competing event because an individual who dies from another cause prior to dementia onset cannot subsequently experience dementia[@tsiatis1975].

Several of the hypothesized or studied exposures that may affect dementia risk can also increase the risk of death. This may explain counterintuitive results, where exposures that are known to be harmful for mortality risk, such as smoking[@abner2019] or history of cancer[@driver2012] sometimes seem protective for the risk of dementia. Authors have attempted to make sense of these counterintuitive results by naming biases such as “competing risk bias” or “survival bias”[@ospina2020].  However, the bias associated with a particular analytic method cannot be defined or assessed if the causal question is not explicitly specified.

Current dementia research guidelines[@power2015] have not explicitly considered what constitutes a meaningful causal question in this setting or, more generally, how this choice justifies and should drive particular analytic decisions. Although previous recommendations in the statistical and epidemiologic methods literature have advocated for the cause-specific hazard ratio when the aim is “etiologic”[@lau2009; @austin2016; @austin2017; @koller2012], these recommendations have contributed to the misconception that “censoring” competing events is equivalent to somehow “ignoring” them[@frain2017].

Recently, Young and colleagues placed core statistical concepts like risk and hazard within a formal causal inference framework and mapped common analytic strategies for competing events to questions about an intervention’s effect either with and without elimination of the competing event, referred as “the controlled direct effect” and “the total effect”[@young2020]. This work clarifies the role of censoring with respect to question formulation, assumptions needed for causal interpretation given real-world data, and particular analytic choices. To contextualize these ideas in the setting of dementia research, we illustrate how to ask and attempt to answer these questions first by describing a hypothetical randomized trial of smoking cessation and then emulating the trial using observational data from the Rotterdam Study[@ikram2020].  

## From questions to methods in dementia studies where some individuals die during study: A pedagogic example

### Observed data structure

Consider the effect of smoking cessation (versus continuing) in late-midlife on developing dementia after 20 years of follow-up.  In order to focus on the challenges to causal inference created by competing events, we begin by considering an idealized randomized trial such that middle-aged smokers are randomly assigned to a strategy of quitting versus continuing smoking. Dementia onset is rigorously measured through constant screening and date of death is collected through linkage with municipal records. Further, suppose in the idealized trial we have complete follow-up (all individuals remain in the study until end of follow-up or until death) and perfect adherence.

Trial participants will be observed to follow different possible event trajectories through the study period: death without developing dementia; dementia onset (some dying after dementia onset); or remaining alive and dementia-free until end of follow-up. For those individuals who died without developing dementia, after the time of death, they cannot subsequently develop dementia. This is the key implication of competing events: they make it impossible for the event of interest to subsequently occur. This determinism is what makes choosing a causal question more difficult than when competing events are absent.

The causal diagram in Figure \@ref(fig:crf1) represents some key features of this data structure, where an arrow from one node A into another node B on a causal diagram reflects that A may cause B[@whatif2020]. In this graph, Smoking represents smoking status, and Death~19~ and Dementia~20~ represent indicators of death by 19 years of follow-up and dementia risk by 20 years of follow-up, respectively. By randomization, we know there are no shared causes of Smoking and other variables represented in the graph (the only cause of quitting smoking is a “coin flip”).  However, we have no such guarantee for death and dementia status over the follow-up and therefore depict shared causes C of dementia and death (such as cardiovascular comorbidities) that may or may not be measured. The arrows from Smoking to Death~19~ and Smoking to Dementia~20~ illustrate that smoking may affect both dementia and death through different mechanisms. The bold arrow from Death~19~ to Dementia~20~ represents the key feature of a competing events data structure: an individual who dies by year 19 of follow-up cannot subsequently develop dementia at the next time point. Though we present death and dementia at years 19 and 20 respectively, the causal diagram could be expanded to include prior assessments, but this simplified causal diagram is sufficient, for our consideration of the different causal effects on dementia in the presence of death.

(ref:crf1) **Causal directed acyclic graph representing key causal features of the data structure.** Smoking represents the exposure status (quit smoking vs. continue smoking), Death~19~ and Dementia~20~ represent indicators of death by 19 years of follow-up and dementia by 20 years of follow-up, respectively. C represents possible shared causes of dementia and death (such as cardiovascular comorbidities, that may or may not be measured). The key relations are: 1) smoking may independently affect both the risk of dementia and death over time through different mechanisms; 2) dying over the first 19 years of follow-up (without prior onset of dementia) determines that the indicator of dementia at 20 years of follow-up is zero (the bold arrow representing this key determinism induced by competing events); and 3) dementia and death can have shared causes.

### Choosing a causal question: the total and controlled direct effect

We say the study we have conceptualized is "ideal" because, for a randomized trial with no loss to follow-up and perfect adherence, we can identify the exposure effect on the outcome of interest through all possible pathways: the total effect. In our example, the following is a question about a total effect: What would the difference in dementia risk by 20-year follow-up be had all individuals in the study population quit smoking versus, instead, had all individuals continued smoking? This dementia risk is an example of a “cause-specific cumulative incidence” or “crude risk”[@tsiatis1975; @geskus2016]. 

Unfortunately, the total effect captures all pathways by which exposure affects dementia, including those mediated by death. In the causal diagram in Figure \@ref(fig:crf1), this includes both the direct effect on dementia (Smoking $\rightarrow$ Dementia~20~) and indirect of smoking via mortality (Smoking $\rightarrow$ Death~19~ $\rightarrow$ Dementia~20~). This indirect effect is necessarily “protective” since participants who die due to smoking at an earlier time point are “protected” from developing dementia. This "pathological mediation" structure gives the total effect a potentially problematic interpretation, since smoking cessation may increase the risk of dementia but primarily or solely because it delays death. Thus, the total effect may not answer a desirable causal question, especially when there is an arrow between the exposure and competing event. Empirical support for this arrow can be obtained by also estimating the effect of smoking cessation on all-cause mortality. 

Instead of a total effect, a direct effect of smoking on the risk of dementia (that does not also capture the pathways mediated by death) may be of interest. There are multiple ways to define a direct effect[@robins1992; @stensrud2020; @frangakis2002]. We present the definition that has been historically considered and may lead to familiar statistical methods as will be described in the next section: the controlled direct effect. In our example, this question is phrased as: What would the difference in dementia risk by 20-year follow-up be had all individuals in the study population quit smoking and not died throughout the study period versus, instead, had all individuals continued smoking and not died throughout the study period? This dementia risk (under elimination of death) is an example of a “net risk” or “marginal cumulative incidence”[@tsiatis1975; @geskus2016] This effect only captures the direct effect of smoking on dementia because it refers to a hypothetical setting in which somehow death could be eliminated. 

The risk differences above both quantify causal effects because they both refer to a comparison of outcome distributions under different interventions but in the same individuals. In contrast, while cause-specific hazard ratios are the basis of the majority of analyses in dementia studies, these generally do not quantify causal effects, even under the conditions of an ideal trial[@young2020; @stensrud2019; @hernan2010]. For this reason, we focus on risks rather than hazard ratios.

In sum, there is no single way to define “the” causal effect on dementia when deaths occur. Choosing either of these research questions should be done in a case-by-case basis. Presenting information on the exposure-mortality association complements both questions.

### Identifying the total versus controlled direct effect in a real-world study

In this section we consider assumptions that help us connect our causal quantity of interest to observable data (i.e., identification). Consider again Figure \@ref(fig:crf1): because exposure was randomized, there are no non-causal paths connecting Smoking and Dementia20[@whatif2020; @pearl1994].  This is consistent with the assumption of “no confounding”, allowing identification of the total effect. In contrast, to identify the controlled direct effect of smoking cessation on the risk of dementia, we need to make the following additional assumptions; that is, “no confounding” ensured by randomization of the exposure is not sufficient.

In Figure \@ref(fig:crf1), we observe the non-causal path between death and dementia through their shared cause C, Dementia~20~ $\leftarrow$ C $\rightarrow$ Death~19~. Thus, even in our ideal trial, we need to measure and adjust for C to identify the controlled direct effect because death is a form of censoring for this question[@young2020]. Censoring is a type of missingness in the outcome of interest. Therefore, what constitutes censoring depends on the question of interest.  When an individual dies prior to dementia onset, dementia onset “under elimination of death” is missing for that individual. While many researchers equate “death” with “censoring”, these terms are not synonymous: death is only a type of censoring (leading to missingness of the dementia outcome) when the question of interest is about outcomes “under elimination of death”.  

In turn, measuring and including the shared cause C in Figure \@ref(fig:crf1) of dementia and death is consistent with an assumption often referred to as conditional independent censoring (here, conditional on C)[@tsiatis1975; @austin2016; @austin2017; @young2020; @geskus2016; @willems2018]. Assuming that there are no shared causes between death and dementia (i.e., assuming the absence of the dotted arrows from C to Death~19~ and Dementia~20~ in Figure \@ref(fig:crf1)) coincides with the assumption of unconditional independent censoring. Unconditional independent censoring is implausible for nearly all dementia research since both events are related to the aging process, while conditional independent censoring assumptions may become more plausible if measuring and adjusting for a rich set of baseline and time-varying shared causes.

Relatedly, loss to follow-up is a form of censoring for total and direct effects. Since mechanisms of loss to follow-up might be related to impaired cognition and dementia, shared causes of attrition and dementia should be measured[@hernan2004; @howe2016]. Further details on censoring and graphical identification of both effects, including scenarios with loss to follow-up, can be found in Young et al.[@young2020].
Statistical methods to estimate the total effect or the controlled direct effect   

Choosing an appropriate statistical method depends jointly on the choice of causal effect and the identifying assumptions we make.  In an ideal trial, the total effect can be trivially estimated by simply comparing two proportions: the proportion diagnosed with dementia at 20-year follow-up in the “quit smoking” arm versus the proportion diagnosed with dementia at 20-year follow-up in the “do not quit smoking” arm.  In both proportions, individuals who die before developing dementia will contribute to the denominator but never to the numerator. Likewise, these quantities can be estimated with the Aalen-Johansen estimator[@young2020; @geskus2016], which extends to settings with loss to follow-up.

In contrast, the controlled direct effect usually requires covariate adjustment on the shared causes of death and dementia.  For example, the controlled direct effect could be estimated by comparing the risk estimates from the complement of a weighted version of the Kaplan-Meier estimator[@young2020], where weights represent the inverse probability of censoring by death conditional on covariates[@young2020; @willems2018; @vangeloven2014; @satten2001; @robins2000]. These covariates should be those assumed to ensure the conditional independent censoring assumption for this form of censoring (e.g., the covariates C in Figure \@ref(fig:crf1)).  

We note that the historic survival-analysis terminology classifies this structure as “semi-competing events” since death is a competing event for dementia but not the other way around. Therefore, we can estimate the risk of all-cause mortality using standard methods like the Kaplan-Meier estimator. In all cases, straightforward extensions exist for covariate adjustment (e.g., by inverse probability weighting) to address loss to follow-up and confounding[@young2020; @howe2016; @cole2015; @xu2012; @howe2011]. As such, these methods can be used both in randomized trials and observational studies, though our consideration of estimation in an ideal trial helps illuminate the unique feature of competing events. 

## Application to the Rotterdam Study

We now illustrate an application of inverse probability weighted methods to estimate total and controlled direct effects of smoking cessation on dementia using data collected from the Rotterdam Study, a population-based prospective cohort study[@ikram2020]. Participants older than 55 years underwent questionnaire administration, physical and clinical examinations, and blood sample collection at baseline (1990-1993) and at follow-up visits from 1993-1995, 1997-1999, 2002-2005, and 2009-2011. Smoking habits were assessed through questionnaires at study entry via self-reported status as “former", “current smoker’’ or “never smoker”. Dementia diagnosis was collected by screening at each visit and through continuous automated linkage with digitized medical records and regional registries. Death certificates were obtained via municipal population registries with complete linkage. Further details are specified in Supplementary Data 1. This ascertainment method means the Rotterdam Study has functionally no loss to follow-up with respect to dementia diagnosis and death. The Rotterdam Study has been approved by the medical ethics committee according to the Population Study Act Rotterdam Study, and written informed consent was obtained.

Individuals ages 55-70 years who reported smoking (current or former) and who did not have history of dementia at cohort entry were eligible for the current study. To emulate the trial described previously, we contrast former and current smokers. This contrast has some limitations when viewed as an emulation of the trial: e.g., there may be unmeasured confounding, selection bias due to misaligning "time zero"[@hernan2016; @howe2018], and measurement error[@whatif2020]. A thorough consideration of these other issues would be critical for evaluating the effect size of smoking cessation on dementia risk, but go beyond the scope of this exercise. For didactic purposes, we therefore focus our attention on how the competing event of death affects the interpretation, analytic decisions, and assumptions evoked. 

### Methods

To estimate the total effect of smoking cessation on dementia risk, we compared a weighted Aalen-Johannsen estimator in current versus former smokers with weights defined as a product of inverse probability of treatment weights[@whatif2020] to adjust for the following possible confounders: age, sex, APOE $\varepsilon4$ carrier status, and educational attainment. Briefly, the weight for a current smoker is defined as the inverse of the probability of smoking conditional on confounders, and for a former smoker as the inverse of quitting conditional on covariates.  We estimated these probabilities with a logistic regression model for smoking as a function of the above-mentioned covariates.

To estimate the controlled direct effect, we compared the complement of a weighted Kaplan-Meier survival estimator in smokers versus former smokers with time indexed in years. The weights in this case are time-varying by follow-up year, defined as a product of the time-fixed weights above and a year-specific inverse probability of censoring by death weights.  For an individual still alive in year _t_, the time _t_ censoring weight is the product of the inverse probability of surviving in each year prior to _t_, conditional on measured shared causes of death and dementia (that is, variables such as C in Figure \@ref(fig:crf1)). For an individual who has died by time _t_, the year _t_ censoring weight is zero. We estimated survival probabilities using a logistic regression model for death as a function of baseline and time-varying covariates. Baseline covariates included smoking status, age, sex, APOE $\varepsilon4$ carrier status, and educational attainment; time-varying covariates included systolic blood pressure, BMI, and prevalent and incident comorbid heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes. All modeling specifications and weights assessment are presented as Supplementary information.

We also estimated the total effect of smoking on mortality risk applying the Kaplan-Meier estimator with the weights calculated for handling confounding. We therefore are assuming the same set of measured confounders used to estimate the total effect of smoking on dementia risk are sufficient for addressing confounding of the total effect of smoking on mortality risk. Estimates of the total and controlled direct effect at 20 years of follow-up are presented as risk differences (RD) and risk ratios (RR). All 95% confidence intervals were calculated using percentile-based bootstrapping with 500 bootstrap samples. All analysis were performed using R.

### Results

Of 10994 Rotterdam Study participants, 4179 individuals met eligibility criteria (55-70 years who reported smoking history at baseline and who did not have history of dementia at study entry). The mean age was 62 years and 1870 (44.7%) were women (Table  \@ref(tab:crt1)). In total, 368 (8.8%) developed dementia and 1318 (31.5%) died over 20 years of follow-up. The median time to dementia was 15.5 years and the median time to death was 13.1 years. Overall, from 1572 who were current smokers at baseline, 117 (7.4%) developed dementia and 630 (40.1%) died; of the 2607 former smokers, 251 (9.6%) developed dementia and 688 (26.4%) died.

We estimated a total effect of smoking cessation (compared to continued smoking) on 20-year dementia risk of 2.1 (95%CI: -0.1, 4.2) percentage points (Table \@ref(tab:crt2); Figure \@ref(fig:crf2)). This slightly harmful effect estimate of quitting smoking (with wide confidence intervals) includes all causal pathways, including that through death. The presence of this pathway is evidenced in the estimated total effect of quitting smoking on 20-year mortality risk: -17.4 (95%CI: -20.5, -14.5) percentage points. Alternatively, we estimated a controlled direct effect of quitting smoking on 20-year dementia risk had death been fully prevented during the study period as -1.9 (95%CI: -5.1, 1.4) percentage points.

## Discussion

In longitudinal (randomized and observational) studies where dementia is the main outcome and deaths occur during follow-up, having a clear causal question and being explicit about the assumptions required for answering them will lead to better interpretations, including a deeper understanding about plausible sources and magnitudes of bias. We considered two causal questions, beginning with the total effect which captures all causal pathways including those mediated by death. In our example, the small estimated harmful total effect of smoking cessation on dementia risk necessarily captures some “protection” against dementia by death. This is not a “bias” but rather a problematic feature of the total effect as the research question.

The controlled direct effect does not have this feature, and in our example, we estimated a small reduction in dementia risk if death was eliminated. However, residual bias from failing to adjust for a sufficient set of shared causes of death and dementia can remain. Since the independent censoring assumption cannot be verified empirically, though bounding can be used to assess extreme scenarios of dependency[@tsiatis1975; @vangeloven2014; @peterson1976; @vangeloven2017]. Furthermore, the controlled direct effect refers to a fictional scenario where everyone remains alive and therefore it generally will not provide useful information for decision-making.

Since both of these questions can seem unsatisfactory, we note that there are yet further alternative questions that can potentially be posed. For example, the “survivor average treatment effect” quantifies the effect of a treatment on a subgroup of individuals who would not die during the study period under either level of treatment[@frangakis2002]. However, the utility of this question is questionable as this subgroup is not observable and may not even exist. One can also consider a combined outcome endpoint, such as the effect on dementia or death; in our example, the effect of smoking on risk of death would drive the effect. A novel alternative of “separable effects” avoids evoking scenarios that “eliminate death” or unobservable subpopulations[@stensrud2020]. Separable effects are effects of modified treatments motivated by the physical decomposition of the exposure assumed to operate on dementia and death through separate pathways or completely different treatments that operate like the study treatment. In this work we focused on the two questions because of their relation to commonly used estimators in dementia research, but we suspect in the future that separable effects will become a more explicit question of interest with the increasing development of useable tools for aiding reasoning.

Too often, we start by defining the statistical method that appears to fit the complexity of data, and we let this decision implicitly determine the research question to be answered. In a setting with competing events, there is no “one size fits all”. Through our discussion and application, we hope that readers will see an opportunity to re-conceptualize how to ask clearer questions in the context of competing events and let the question define the methods that best suit the research aim.

#### The Rotterdam Study, outcome assessments {-}

_Dementia diagnosis_: Diagnosis was collected by screening during the five study visits, using MMSE and the Geriatric Mental Schedule (GMS) organic level. Screen-positives (MMSE<26 or GMS organic level>0) subsequently underwent an examination and informant interview with the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders in the Elderly. A consensus panel led by a consultant neurologist established the final diagnosis according to standard criteria for dementia (DSM-III-R). Additionally, participants were continuously followed for the occurrence of dementia through automated linkage of the study database and digitized medical records from general practitioners and the Regional Institute for Outpatient Mental Health Care. For participants who moved outside the study district or lived in nursing homes, medical records were regularly checked by contacting their treating physicians. Research physicians reviewed all potential dementia cases using hospital discharge letters and information from general practitioners and nursing home physicians3. Linkage-based diagnoses were based on data up through December 2015.


_Vital status:_ Vital status was obtained on a weekly basis via municipal population registries and through general practitioners’ and hospitals’ databases, with complete linkage up through December 2015.
