  abstract = {Tobacco smoking was examined as a risk for dementia and neuropathological burden in 531 initially cognitively normal older adults followed longitudinally at the University of Kentucky's Alzheimer's Disease Center. The cohort was followed for an average of 11.5 years; 111 (20.9\%) participants were diagnosed with dementia, while 242 (45.6\%) died without dementia. At baseline, 49 (9.2\%) participants reported current smoking (median pack-years = 47.3) and 231 (43.5\%) former smoking (median pack-years = 24.5). The hazard ratio (HR) for dementia for former smokers versus never smokers based on the Cox model was 1.64 (95\% CI: 1.09, 2.46), while the HR for current smokers versus never smokers was 1.20 (0.50, 2.87). However, the Fine-Gray model, which accounts for the competing risk of death without dementia, yielded a subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) = 1.21 (0.81, 1.80) for former and 0.70 (0.30, 1.64) for current smokers. In contrast, current smoking increased incidence of death without dementia (sHR = 2.38; 1.52, 3.72). All analyses were adjusted for baseline age, education, sex, diabetes, head injury, hypertension, overweight, APOE ␧4, family history of dementia, and use of hormone replacement therapy. Once adjusted for the competing risk of death without dementia, smoking was not associated with incident dementia. This finding was supported by neuropathology on 302 of the participants.},

  abstract = {Summary Background This programme of overviews of randomised trials was established to investigate the effects of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and other blood-pressure-lowering drugs on mortality and major cardiovascular morbidity in several populations of patients. We did separate overviews of trials comparing active treatment regimens with placebo, trials comparing more intensive and less intensive blood-pressure-lowering strategies, and trials comparing treatment regimens based on different drug classes. Methods The hypotheses to be investigated, the trials to be included, and the outcomes to be studied were all selected before the results of any participating trial were known. Individual participant data or group tabular data were provided by each trial and combined by standard statistical techniques. Findings The overview of placebo-controlled trials of ACE inhibitors (four trials, 12\hphantom{,}124 patients mostly with coronary heart disease) revealed reductions in stroke (30\% [95\% Cl 15\textendash 43]), coronary heart disease (20\% [11\textendash 28]), and major cardiovascular events (21\% [14\textendash 27]). The overview of placebo-controlled trials of calcium antagonists (two trials, 5520 patients mostly with hypertension) showed reductions in stroke (39\% [15\textendash 56]) and major cardiovascular events (28\% [13\textendash 41]). In the overview of trials comparing blood-pressure-lowering strategies of different intensity (three trials, 20\hphantom{,}408 patients with hypertension), there were reduced risks of stroke (20\% [2\textendash 35]), coronary heart disease (19\% [2\textendash 33]), and major cardiovascular events (15\% [4\textendash 24]) with more intensive therapy. In the overviews comparing different antihypertensive regimens (eight trials, 37\hphantom{,}872 patients with hypertension), several differences in cause-specific effects were seen between calcium-antagonist-based therapy and other regimens, but each was of borderline significance. Interpretation Strong evidence of benefits of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists is provided by the overviews of placebo-controlled trials. There is weaker evidence of differences between treatment regimens of differing intensities and of differences between treatment regimens based on different drug classes. Data from continuing trials of blood-pressure-lowering drugs will substantially increase the evidence available about any real differences that might exist between regimens.}

Furthermore, the genetically modulated reduction of capacity for neural repair and neurotransmitter activity, as well as reduced antioxidant capacity associated with treatmentinduced reduction in oestrogen and testosterone levels, might interact with these mechanisms and/ or have independent effects on cognitive function.},

Microbleeds are also frequently found in healthy elderly, a population in which the clinical implication of microbleeds is unknown. Methods and Results\textemdash In the population-based Rotterdam Study, the presence, number, and location of microbleeds were assessed at baseline on brain MRI of 4759 participants aged {$\geq$}45 years. Participants were followed for incident stroke throughout the study period (2005\textendash 2013). We used Cox proportional hazards to investigate if people with microbleeds were at increased risk of stroke in comparison with those without microbleeds, adjusting for demographic, genetic, and cardiovascular risk, and cerebrovascular imaging markers. Microbleed prevalence was 18.7\% (median count 1 [1\textendash 111]). During mean follow-up of 4.9 years (standard deviation, 1.6) 93 strokes occurred (72 ischemic, 11 hemorrhagic, and 10 unspecified). Microbleed presence was associated with an increased risk of all strokes (hazard ratio, 1.93; 95\% confidence interval, 1.25\textendash 2.99). The risk increased with greater microbleed count. In comparison with those without microbleeds, participants with microbleeds in locations suggestive of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (lobar with or without cerebellar microbleeds) were at increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (hazard ratio, 5.27; 95\% confidence interval, 1.38\textendash 20.23). Microbleeds at other locations were associated with an increased risk of both ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage. Conclusions\textemdash Microbleeds on MRI are associated with an increased risk of stroke in the general population.

After its initial impact in Asia, the highest case growth is now in the Americas. The South American countries face a strong challenge due to the vulnerabilities of their health systems and the fragile socio-economic conditions of their population. This perspective looks at the impact of COVID-19 in South America and argues that the health critical care systems of these countries are particularly vulnerable due to the underestimation of the number of cases currently confirmed and the strong need for treatment of these patients in intensive care units (ICUs). In particular, Bolivia will need to increase the number of ICU beds 60-fold while Brazil will need to grow 12-fold to meet the growth rates of COVID-19 by the end of July 2020. In this sense, it is argued that national and transnational measures should be taken urgently to face this challenge. Furthermore, it is necessary to perform tests to detect COVID-19 cases earlier to alleviate the need for internment in ICUs.},

Cognitive performance (global cognitive functioning, visual memory, verbal fluency, psychomotor speed, and executive function), clinical diagnosis of dementia, and fibrate and statin use, were evaluated at baseline, and 2, 4, and 7 year follow-up. Multivariate Cox models were stratified by gender and adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, mental and physical health including vascular risk factors, and genetic vulnerability (apolipoprotein E and cholesteryl ester transfer protein). For women but not men, fibrate use was specifically associated with an increased risk over 7 years of decline in visual memory only (HR = 1.29, 95\% CI = 1.09\textendash 1.54, p = 0.004), and did not increase risk for incident dementia. This association was independent of genetic vulnerability related to apolipoprotein E and cholesteryl exchange transfer protein polymorphisms and occurred only in women with higher low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels and treated with fibrate (HR = 1.39, 95\% CI = 1.08\textendash 1.79, p = 0.01) and not in those with lower LDL-cholesterol levels irrespective of fibrate treatment. For both genders, no significant associations were found between statins (irrespective of their lipophilicity) and either cognitive decline or dementia incidence. This prospective study, adjusting for multiple confounders, found no evidence that LLA given in late life reduced the risk of cognitive decline and dementia, but did raise the possibility that women with treatment-resistant high LDL-cholesterol may be at increased risk of decline in visual memory.},

An important consequence of this relation is that regression models such as the proportional hazards model that are defined through the hazard (the rate) immediately dictate how the covariates relate to the survival function (the risk). Methods This introductory paper reviews the concepts of rate and risk and their one-to-one relation in all-cause mortality studies and introduces the analogous concepts of rate and risk in the context of competing risks, the cause-specific hazard and the cause-specific cumulative incidence function. Results The key feature of competing risks is that the one-to-one correspondence between cause-specific hazard and cumulative incidence, between rate and risk, is lost. This fact has two important implications. First, the na\textasciidieresis\i ve Kaplan\textendash Meier that takes the competing events as censored observations, is biased. Secondly, the way in which covariates are associated with the cause-specific hazards may not coincide with the way these covariates are associated with the cumulative incidence. An example with relapse and non-relapse mortality as competing risks in a stem cell transplantation study is used for illustration. Conclusion The two implications of the loss of one-to-one correspondence between cause-specific hazard and cumulative incidence should be kept in mind when deciding on how to make inference in a competing risks situation.},

  abstract = {Increased survival, differentiation, and apoptotic death are common mechanisms relevant for both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Although these disorders are characterized by different manifestations, it appears that a common mechanism may be present which directs the fate of a cell to either degeneration or proliferation. There are two classes of proteins that have been extensively investigated in these diseases but their possible interaction during signal transduction has not been studied. Prolyl isomerase Pin1 is an enzyme which translates Ser/Thr-Pro phosphorylation into conformational changes able to modify the activities of its substrates. Its role in cancer development has been linked to its capacity to induce conformational changes to the tumor suppressor gene p53. Neurotrophins belong to a family of proteins that induce opposite effects on neuronal cells such as increased survival, development, and function. According to their function, alteration of these proteins during neurodegenerative processes has been investigated and reported in a number of experimental paradigms involving animal models and humans. However, in recent years, it has been shown that Pin1 downregulation is present in neurodegenerative disorders, while increased expression of neurotrophins and their receptors is found in certain types of cancer and correlate with poor prognosis. Notably, at the level of signal transduction, Pin1 and neurotrophin activity regulate the outcome of similar pathways such as proline-directed kinase and, most importantly, p53 signaling. Thus the possible existence of a loop between Pin1 and neurotrophins was investigated to understand the pathogenesis of these diseases.},

Methods: Participants were 929 older Catholic clergy (68.7\% women, mean baseline age 74.9 years, education 18.2 years, Mini-Mental State Examination 28.5) free of dementia, enrolled in the Religious Orders Study, a longitudinal clinical-pathologic study of AD. All agreed to brain autopsy at time of death and underwent annual structured clinical evaluations, allowing for classification of AD and assessment of cognition (based on 19 neuropsychological tests). Statins were identified by direct medication inspection. Neuropathologic data were available on 262 participants. All macroscopic chronic cerebral infarctions were recorded. A measure of global AD pathology was derived from silver stain, and separate measures of amyloid and tangles were based on immunohistochemistry. We examined the relation of statins to incident AD using Cox proportional hazards, change in cognition using mixed effects models, and pathologic indices using logistic and linear regression. Results: Statin use at baseline (12.8\%) was not associated with incident AD (191 persons, up to 12 follow-up years), change in global cognition, or five separate cognitive domains (all p values \&gt; 0.20). Statin use any time prior to death (17.9\%) was not related to global AD pathology. Persons taking statins were less likely to have amyloid (p = 0.02). However, among those with amyloid, there was no relation of statins to amyloid load. Statins were not related to tangles or infarction. Conclusions: Overall, statins were not related to incident Alzheimer disease (AD) or change in cognition, or continuous measures of AD pathology or infarction.

In the future, novel AD transcriptional signatures from cells isolated at early stages of disease, or from human neurons or microglia that carry mutations that increase the risk of AD, might be used as probes to identify additional candidate drugs. Phase II trials assessing repurposed agents must consider the best target population for a specific candidate therapy as well as the mechanism of action of the treatment.

In a prospective longitudinal study we have previously shown an inverse association between AD and cancer, such that the rate of developing cancer in general with time was significantly slower in participants with AD, while participants with a history of cancer had a slower rate of developing AD. In cancer, cell regulation mechanisms are disrupted with augmentation of cell survival and/or proliferation, whereas conversely, AD is associated with increased neuronal death, either caused by, or concomitant with, beta amyloid (A{$\beta$}) and tau deposition. The possibility that perturbations of mechanisms involved in cell survival/death regulation could be involved in both disorders is discussed. Genetic polymorphisms, DNA methylation or other mechanisms that induce changes in activity of molecules with key roles in determining the decision to ``repair and live''- or ``die'' could be involved in the pathogenesis of the two disorders. As examples, the role of p53, Pin1 and the Wnt signaling pathway are discussed as potential candidates that, speculatively, may explain inverse associations between AD and cancer.},

  abstract = {Objective: To examine the association of statin drug use on cognitive and MRI change in older adults. Methods: Participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study, a longitudinal study of people age 65 or older, were classified into three groups determined by whether they were taking statin drugs on a continuous basis, intermittently, or not at all. The untreated group was further divided into categories based on National Cholesterol Education Program recommendations for lipid-lowering treatment. Participants with prevalent or incident clinical TIA or stroke or with baseline Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) scores at or below 80 were excluded. Outcomes examined included rate of change on the 3MS over an average observational period of 7 years, along with changes in MRI white matter grade and measures of atrophy. Results: Three thousand three hundred thirty-four participants had adequate data for analysis. At baseline, the untreated group in which lipid-lowering drug treatment was recommended were slightly older, less likely to be on estrogen replacement, and had higher serum cholesterol and lower 3MS scores than the statin-treated group. The rate of decline on the 3MS was 0.48 point/year less in those taking statins compared with the untreated group for which treatment was recommended (p ϭ 0.069) and 0.49 point/year less in statin users compared with the group in which lipid-lowering treatment was not recommended (p ϭ 0.009). This effect remained after controlling for serum cholesterol levels. One thousand seven hundred thirty participants with baseline 3MS scores of Ͼ80 underwent cranial MRI scans on two occasions separated by 5 years. There was no significant difference in white matter grade change or atrophy measures between groups. Conclusion: Statin drug use was associated with a slight reduction in cognitive decline in an elderly population. This relationship could not be completely explained by the effect of statins on lowering of serum cholesterol.},

  abstract = {Background Statin use and serum cholesterol reduction have been proposed as preventions for dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods 1604 and 1345 eligible participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) were followed after age 50 for a median time of around 25 years, to examine the incidence of dementia (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}259) and MCI (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}138), respectively. Statin use (ever-use and time-dependent use), total cholesterol levels (TC; first visit and time-dependent), TC change trajectory from first visit and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C):TC ratio (first visit and time-dependent) were the main exposures of interest. Cox proportional hazards models were used. Results Participants with incident dementia had a higher first-visit TC compared with participants who remained free of dementia and MCI, while first-visit TC was higher among statin ever-users compared with never-users (age-unadjusted associations). Statin users had a twoto threefold lower risk of developing dementia (HR{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.41; 95\% CI 0.18 to 0.92), but not MCI, when considering time-dependent `statin use' with propensity score model adjustment. This association remained significant independently of serum cholesterol exposures. An elevated first-visit TC was associated with reduced MCI risk (upper quartile (Q4) vs Q1: HR{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.51; 95\% CI 0.29 to 0.90). Compared with the lowest quartile (Q1: 0.00e0.19), HDL-C:TC (time-dependent) in (Q2: 0.19e0.24) was associated with reduced MCI risk (HR{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.58; 95\% CI 0.34 to 0.98). Among men only, TC decline from first visit was significantly associated with increased dementia risk (HR{$\frac{1}{4}$}4.21; 95\% CI 1.28 to 13.85). Conclusions Statins may have multifactorial effects on dementia but not MCI risk. Future interventions may be warranted, and research should focus on optimal serum TC, HDL-C:TC ratio and TC change trajectories.},

  abstract = {Objective To assess whether long-term treatment with candesartan/hydrochlorothiazide, rosuvastatin, or their combination can slow cognitive decline in older people at intermediate cardiovascular risk. Methods The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation-3 (HOPE-3) study was a double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled clinical trial using a 2 \texttimes{} 2 factorial design. Participants without known cardiovascular disease or need for treatment were randomized to candesartan (16 mg) plus hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) or placebo and to rosuvastatin (10 mg) or placebo. Participants who were {$\geq$}70 years of age completed the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), the modified Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and the Trail Making Test Part B at baseline and study end. Results Cognitive assessments were completed by 2,361 participants from 228 centers in 21 countries. Compared with placebo, candesartan/hydrochlorothiazide reduced systolic blood pressure by 6.0 mm Hg, and rosuvastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 24.8 mg/dL. Participants were followed up for 5.7 years (median), and 1,626 completed both baseline and study-end assessments. Mean participant age was 74 years (SD {$\pm$}3.5 years); 59\% were women; 45\% had hypertension; and 24\% had {$\geq$}12 years of education. The mean difference in change in DSST scores was -0.91 (95\% confidence interval [CI] -2.25 to 0.42) for candesartan/hydrochlorothiazide compared with placebo, -0.54 (95\% CI -1.88 to 0.80) for rosuvastatin compared with placebo, and -1.43 (95\% CI -3.37 to 0.50) for combination therapy vs double placebo. No significant differences were found for other measures. Conclusions Long-term blood pressure lowering with candesartan plus hydrochlorothiazide, rosuvastatin, or their combination did not significantly affect cognitive decline in older people.},

We applied this method to data from the French Hospital database on HIV (FHDH-ANRS CO4), an observational study of HIV-infected patients, in order to compare dynamic regimes of the form ``initiate treatment within m months after the recorded CD4 cell count first drops below x cells/mm3" where x takes values from 200 to 500 in increments of 10 and m takes values 0 or 3.

  abstract = {Objective: Observational data can be used to attempt to emulate a target trial of statin use and estimate analogues of intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects on dementia risk. Methods: Using data from a prospective cohort study in the Netherlands, we conceptualized a sequence of ``trials'' in which eligible individuals ages 55-80 years were classified as statin D initiators or non-initiators for every consecutive month between 1993 and 2007 and were followed until diagnosis of dementia, death, loss to follow-up, or the end of follow-up. We E estimated two types of effects of statin use on dementia and a combined endpoint of dementia or death: the effect of initiation versus no initiation and the effect of sustained use versus no use. T We estimated risk by statin treatment strategy over time via pooled logistic regression. We used P inverse-probability weighting to account for treatment-confounder feedback in estimation of perprotocol effects. E Results: Of 233,526 eligible person-trials (6,373 individuals), there were 622 initiators and 232,904 non-initiators. Comparing statin initiation with no initiation, the 10-year risk differences C (95\% CI) were -0.1\% (-2.3\%, 1.8\%) for dementia and 0.3\% (-2.7\%, 3.3\%) for dementia or death. Comparing sustained statin use versus no use, the 10-year risk differences were -2.2\% (-5.2\%, AC 1.6\%) for dementia and -5.1\% (-10.5\%, -1.1\%) for dementia or death. Conclusions: Individuals with sustained statin use, but not statin initiation alone, had reduced 10-year risks of dementia and dementia or death. Our results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of initiators and events, and potential for residual confounding.},

Little is known about the impact of multiple lifestyle factors on the risk of stroke. Methods and Results\textemdash We conducted a prospective cohort study among 43 685 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and 71 243 women from the Nurses' Health Study. Diet and other lifestyle factors were updated from self-reported questionnaires. We defined a low-risk lifestyle as not smoking, a body mass index Ͻ25 kg/m2, Ն30 min/d of moderate activity, modest alcohol consumption (men, 5 to 30 g/d; women, 5 to 15 g/d), and scoring within the top 40\% of a healthy diet score. We documented 1559 strokes (853 ischemic, 278 hemorrhagic) among women and 994 strokes (600 ischemic, 161 hemorrhagic) among men during follow-up. Women with all 5 low-risk factors had a relative risk of 0.21 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.12, 0.36) for total and 0.19 (95\% CI, 0.09, 0.40) for ischemic stroke compared with women who had none of these factors. Among men, the relative risks were 0.31 (95\% CI, 0.19, 0.53) for total and 0.20 (95\% CI, 0.10, 0.42) for ischemic stroke for the same comparison. Among the women, 47\% (95\% CI, 18 to 69) of total and 54\% (95\% CI, 15 to 78\%) of ischemic stroke cases were attributable to lack of adherence to a low-risk lifestyle; among the men, 35\% (95\% CI, 7 to 58) of total and 52\% (95\% CI, 19 to 75) of ischemic stroke may have been prevented. Conclusion\textemdash A low-risk lifestyle that is associated with a reduced risk of multiple chronic diseases also may be beneficial in the prevention of stroke, especially ischemic stroke.

  abstract = {Background: Statins are widely used in clinical treatment. However, an U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued health alert has raised concerns for the adverse effects of statin-associated confusion and memory loss in the elderly people. It is necessary to clarify the relationship between statin use and risk of incident dementia as well as whether class effects exist. Methods: In this population-based retrospective cohort study, total 33,398 patients aged {$\geq$} 60 years were selected from a subset of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Databases and followed up for tracking the occurrence of any type of dementia from 2000 to 2010. The Cox proportional hazards models were used. Results: Compared to nonusers, statin users had a significantly lower risk of incident dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.72\textendash 0.85, p b 0.001). The potency and the cumulative duration of statin utilized were associated with the reducing risk of dementia. After stratifying by gender, the risk of incident dementia was lower in female statin users (HR, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.68\textendash 0.85, p b 0.001) than in male statin users (HR, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.75\textendash 0.98, p = 0.024). Higher potency and longer cumulative duration of statin use were required for reducing the risk of incident dementia in male patients than in female patients. Conclusion: Statin use was associated with a significantly lower risk of dementia in the elderly patients in Taiwan. The potency and the cumulative duration of statin utilized played critical roles. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The aim of this analysis is, beginning with a reconstruction of the contributions of the two authors, to show how the newly founded ``art of conjecture'' was the object of divergent interpretations, from the characterisation of its theoretical principles, such as the concept of expectation, to the question of its legitimacy in applications as a ``guide to practical living''.},

  abstract = {Objective: Evidence of a relation between use of lipid lowering drugs and cognitive outcomes is mixed. This study aimed to test the association between use of statins and incidence of dementia and cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND) over 5 years of follow-up. Methods: Data were from a population-based cohort study comprising 1,789 older Mexican Americans. All participants had cognitive and clinical evaluations performed every 12 to 15 months. Participants who fell below specified cutpoints on cognitive tests were then evaluated clinically. Dementia diagnoses were finalized by an adjudication team. A total of 1,674 participants free of dementia/CIND at baseline were included in these analyses. Statin use was verified at each participant's home by medicine cabinet inspection. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between statin use and incidence of dementia/CIND. Results: Overall, 452 of 1,674 participants (27\%) took statins at any time during the study. Over the 5-year follow-up period, 130 participants developed dementia/CIND. In Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for education, smoking status, presence of at least one APOE ␧4 allele, and history of stroke or diabetes at baseline, persons who had used statins were about half as likely as those who did not use statins to develop dementia/CIND (HR ϭ 0.52; 95\% CI 0.34, 0.80). Conclusion: Statin users were less likely to have incident dementia/cognitive impairment without dementia during a 5-year follow-up. These results add to the emerging evidence suggesting a protective effect of statin use on cognitive outcomes. Neurology\textregistered{} 2008;71:344\textendash 350},

Prospective studies have examined the associations between lifestyle factors and diabetes in healthy populations but have not characterized the intervention. We estimated the long-term effects of hypothetical lifestyle interventions on diabetes in a prospective study of healthy women, using the parametric g-formula. Methods: Using data from the Nurses' Health Study, we followed 76,402 women from 1984 to 2008. We estimated the risk of type 2 diabetes under eight hypothetical interventions: quitting smoking, losing weight by 5\% every 2 years if overweight/obese, exercising at least 30 minutes a day, eating less than three servings a week of red meat, eating at least two servings a day of whole grain, drinking two or more cups of coffee a day, drinking five or more grams of alcohol a day, and drinking less than one serving of soda a week. Results: The 24-year risk of diabetes was 9.6\% under no intervention and 4.3\% when all interventions were imposed (55\% lower risk [95\% confidence interval = 47 to 63\%]). The most effective interventions were weight loss (24\% lower risk), physical activity (19\%), and moderate alcohol use (19\%). Overweight/obese women would benefit the most, with 10.8 percentage point reduction in 24-year risk of diabetes. The validity of these estimates relies on the absence of unmeasured confounding, measurement error, and model misspecification. Conclusion: A combination of dietary and nondietary lifestyle modifications, begun in midlife or later in relatively healthy women, could have prevented at least half of the cases of type 2 diabetes in this cohort of U.S. women.},

The basic idea is using an observational study to emulate a hypothetical randomised trial by comparing initiators versus non-initiators of treatment. After adjustment for measured baseline confounders, one can then conduct the observational analogue of an intention-to-treat analysis. We also explain two approaches to conduct the analogues of per-protocol and as-treated analyses after further adjusting for measured timevarying confounding and selection bias using inverse-probability weighting. As an example, we implemented these methods to estimate the effect of statins for primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) using data from electronic medical records in the UK. Despite strong confounding by indication, our approach detected a potential benefit of statin therapy. The analogue of the intention-totreat hazard ratio (HR) of CHD was 0.89 (0.73, 1.09) for statin initiators versus non-initiators. The HR of CHD was 0.84 (0.54, 1.30) in the per-protocol analysis and 0.79 (0.41, 1.41) in the as-treated analysis for 2 years of use versus no use. In contrast, a conventional comparison of current users versus never users of statin therapy resulted in a HR of 1.31 (1.04, 1.66). We provide a flexible and annotated SAS program to implement the proposed analyses.},

For per-protocol effects, we describe two methods for adherence adjustment via inverse-probability weighting. Study Design and Setting: Prospective observational study using electronic medical records of individuals aged 55e84 with coronary heart disease from O500 practices in the United Kingdom between 2000 and 2010. Results: The intention-to-treat mortality hazard ratio (95\% confidence interval) was 0.90 (0.84, 0.97) for statins vs. no treatment, 0.88 (0.73, 1.06) for statins plus antihypertensives vs. no treatment, and 0.91 (0.77, 1.06) for atorvastatin vs. simvastatin. When censoring nonadherent person-times, the per-protocol mortality hazard ratio was 0.74 (0.64, 0.85) for statins vs. no treatment, 0.55 (0.35, 0.87) for statins plus antihypertensives vs. no treatment, and 1.13 (0.88, 1.45) for atorvastatin vs. simvastatin. We estimated per-protocol hazard ratios for a 5-year treatment using different dose-response marginal structural models and standardized survival curves for each target trial using intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Conclusion: When randomized trials are not available or feasible, observational analyses can emulate a variety of target trials. \'O 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We provide contemporary estimates of the proportion of dementia cases that could be prevented if modifiable risk factors were eliminated, i.e., population attributable risk (PAR). Furthermore, we studied whether the PAR has changed across the last two decades. Methods: We included 7,003 participants of the original cohort (starting in 1990) and 2,953 participants of the extended cohort (starting in 2000) of the Rotterdam Study. Both cohorts were followed for dementia until ten years after baseline. We calculated the PAR of overweight, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cholesterol, smoking, and education. Additionally, we assessed the PAR of stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. We calculated the PAR for each risk factor separately and the combined PAR taking into account the interaction of risk factors. Results: During 57,996 person-years, 624 participants of the original cohort developed dementia, and during 26,177 person-years, 145 participants of the extended cohort developed dementia. The combined PAR in the original cohort was 0.23 (95 \% CI, 0.05\textendash 0.62). The PAR in the extended cohort was slightly higher at 0.30 (95 \% CI, 0.06\textendash 0.76). The combined PAR including cardiovascular diseases was 0.25 (95 \% CI, 0.07\textendash 0.62) in the original cohort and 0.33 (95 \% CI, 0.07\textendash 0.77) in the extended cohort. Conclusions: A substantial part of dementia cases could be prevented if modifiable risk factors would be eliminated. Although prevention and treatment options of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases have improved, the preventive potential for dementia has not declined over the last two decades.},

  abstract = {Summary Background The treatment of ischaemic stroke with neuroprotective drugs has been unsuccessful, and whether these compounds can be used to reduce disability after recurrent stroke is unknown. The putative neuroprotective effects of antiplatelet compounds and the angiotensin II receptor antagonist telmisartan were investigated in the Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes (PRoFESS) trial. Methods Patients who had had an ischaemic stroke were randomly assigned in a two by two factorial design to receive either 25 mg aspirin (ASA) and 200 mg extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) twice a day or 75 mg clopidogrel once a day, and either 80 mg telmisartan or placebo once per day. The predefined endpoints for this substudy were disability after a recurrent stroke, assessed with the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and Barthel index at 3 months, and cognitive function, assessed with the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score at 4 weeks after randomisation and at the penultimate visit. Analysis was by intention to treat. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NTC00153062. Findings 20\hphantom{,}332 patients (mean age 66 years) were randomised and followed-up for a median of 2{$\cdot$}4 years. Recurrent strokes occurred in 916 (9\%) patients randomly assigned to ASA with ER-DP and 898 (9\%) patients randomly assigned to clopidogrel; 880 (9\%) patients randomly assigned to telmisartan and 934 (9\%) patients given placebo had recurrent strokes. mRS scores were not statistically different in patients with recurrent stroke who were treated with ASA and ER-DP versus clopidogrel (p=0{$\cdot$}38), or with telmisartan versus placebo (p=0{$\cdot$}61). There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with recurrent stroke with a good outcome, as measured with the Barthel index, across all treatment groups. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the median MMSE scores, the percentage of patients with an MMSE score of 24 points or less, the percentage of patients with a drop in MMSE score of 3 points or more between 1 month and the penultimate visit, and the number of patients with dementia among the treatment groups. There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients with cognitive impairment or dementia among the treatment groups. Interpretation Disability due to recurrent stroke and cognitive decline in patients with ischaemic stroke were not different between the two antiplatelet regimens and were not affected by the preventive use of telmisartan.

Design Community based prospective cohort study; nested age and sex matched case-control study. Setting Framingham Heart Study, USA. Participants 1278 participants with and without a history of cancer who were aged 65 or more and free of dementia at baseline (1986-90). Main outcome measures Hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for the risks of Alzheimer's disease and cancer. Results Over a mean follow-up of 10 years, 221 cases of probable Alzheimer's disease were diagnosed. Cancer survivors had a lower risk of probable Alzheimer's disease (hazard ratio 0.67, 95\% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.97), adjusted for age, sex, and smoking. The risk was lower among survivors of smoking related cancers (0.26, 0.08 to 0.82) than among survivors of non-smoking related cancers (0.82, 0.57 to 1.19). In contrast with their decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease, survivors of smoking related cancer had a substantially increased risk of stroke (2.18, 1.29 to 3.68). In the nested case-control analysis, participants with probable Alzheimer's disease had a lower risk of subsequent cancer (0.39, 0.26 to 0.58) than reference participants, as did participants with any Alzheimer's disease (0.38) and any dementia (0.44).

  abstract = {Background: Several small scale clinical trials indicated a possible relationship between chemotherapy administration and the increased risk of cognitive impairments in patients with breast cancer, but little information was available from large population-based cohort studies. Methods: We studied 62,565 women who were diagnosed with stages I-IV breast cancer at age Ն65 years from 1991 through 2002 from 16 regions in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program who were free of cognitive impairments at diagnosis with up to 16 years of follow-up, and also studied 9752 matched cohort based on the propensity of receiving chemotherapy. The cumulative incidence of cognitive impairments was calculated and the time to event (cognitive impairments) analysis was conducted using Cox hazard regression model. Results: Overall, patients who received chemotherapy were 8\% more likely to have drug-induced dementia compared with those without chemotherapy, but that was not statistically significant after adjusting for patient and tumor characteristics (hazard ratio ϭ 1.08, 95\% confidence interval ϭ 0.85\textendash 1.37). The risk of developing Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, or other dementias was significantly lower in patients receiving chemotherapy except for cognitive disorder which was not significantly different between the 2 chemotherapy groups. The results were somewhat similar in the entire cohort and the matched cohort based on the probability of receiving chemotherapy. Conclusion: There was no significant association between chemotherapy and the risk of developing drug-induced dementia and unspecified cognitive disorders. The risk of developing Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, or other dementias was significantly lower in patients receiving chemotherapy. This study with long-term follow-up did not support the findings that chemotherapy was associated with an increased risk of late stage cognitive impairments.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To emulate a randomized trial of statin therapy initiation that is free of selection bias and immortal-time bias. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used observational data on 17 372 patients with cancer from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database (2007-2009) with complete follow-up until 2011. The SEER-Medicare database links 17 US cancer registries and claims files from Medicare and Medicaid in 12 US states. We included individuals with a new diagnosis of colorectal, breast, prostate, or bladder cancer who had not been prescribed statins for at least 6 months before the cancer diagnosis. Individuals were duplicated, and each replicate was assigned to either the strategy ``statin therapy initiation within 6 months after diagnosis'' or ``no statin therapy initiation.'' Replicates were censored when they stopped following their assigned strategy, and the potential selection bias was adjusted for via inverse-probability weighting. Hazard ratios (HRs), cumulative incidences, and risk differences were calculated for all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality. We then compared our estimates with those obtained using the same analytic approaches used in previous observational studies. EXPOSURES Statin therapy initiation within 6 months after cancer diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cancer-specific and all-cause mortality using SEER-Medicare data and data from previous studies. Supplemental content RESULTS Of the 17 372 patients whose data were analyzed, 8440 (49\%) were men, and 8932 (51\%) were women (mean [SD] age, 76.4 [7.4] years; range, 66-115 years). The adjusted HR (95\% CI) comparing statin therapy initiation vs no initiation was 1.00 (0.88-1.15) for cancer-specific mortality and 1.07 (0.93-1.21) for overall mortality. Cumulative incidence curves for both groups were almost overlapping (the risk difference never exceeded 0.8\%). In contrast, the methods used by prior studies resulted in an inverse association between statin use and mortality (pooled hazard ratio 0.69). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE After using methods that are not susceptible to selection bias from prevalent users and to immortal time bias, we found that initiation of therapy with statins within 6 months after cancer diagnosis did not appear to improve 3-year cancer-specific or overall survival.},

Their systolic blood pressure at entry was 160 to 219 mm Hg, with diastolic blood pressure below 95 mm Hg. Antihypertensive therapy was started immediately after randomization in the active treatment group, but only after termination of the double-blind trial in the control patients. Treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/d), with the possible addition of enalapril maleate (5-20 mg/d), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/d), or both add-on drugs.Median follow-up increased from 2.0 years in the double-blind trial to 3.9 years overall. The incidence of dementia doubled from 32 to 64 cases, 41 of whom had Alzheimer disease. Throughout follow-up, systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 7.0/3.2 mm Hg higher in the 1417 control patients than in the 1485 subjects randomized to active treatment. At the last examination, the blood pressure difference was still 4.2/2.9 mm Hg; 48.1\%, 26.4\%, and 11.4\% of the control patients were taking nitrendipine, enalapril, and/or hydrochlorothiazide, whereas in the active treatment group these proportions were 70.2\%, 35.4\%, and 18.4\%, respectively. Compared with the controls, long-term antihypertensive therapy reduced the risk of dementia by 55\%, from 7.4 to 3.3 cases per 1000 patient-years (43 vs 21 cases, P\&lt;.001). After adjustment for sex, age, education, and entry blood pressure, the relative hazard rate associated with the use of nitrendipine was 0.38 (95\% confidence interval, 0.23-0.64; P\&lt;.001). Treatment of 1000 patients for 5 years can prevent 20 cases of dementia (95\% confidence interval, 7-33).The extended follow-up of Syst-Eur patients reinforces the evidence that blood pressure\textendash lowering therapy initiated with a long-acting dihydropyridine protects against dementia in older patients with systolic hypertension.Arch Intern Med. 2002;162:2046-2052--{$>$}}

  abstract = {Many scientific problems require that treatment comparisons be adjusted for posttreatment variables, but the estimands underlying standard methods are not causal effects. To address this deficiency, we propose a general framework for comparing treatments adjusting for posttreatment variables that yields principal effects based on principal stratification. Principal stratification with respect to a posttreatment variable is a cross-classification of subjects defined by the joint potential values of that posttreatment variable under each of the treatments being compared. Principal effects are causal effects within a principal stratum. The key property of principal strata is that they are not affected by treatment assignment and therefore can be used just as any pretreatment covariate, such as age category. As a result, the central property of our principal effects is that they are always causal effects and do not suffer from the complications of standard posttreatment-adjusted estimands. We discuss briefly that such principal causal effects are the link between three recent applications with adjustment for posttreatment variables: (i) treatment noncompliance, (ii) missing outcomes (dropout) following treatment noncompliance, and (iii) censoring by death. We then attack the problem of surrogate or biomarker endpoints, where we show, using principal causal effects, that all current definitions of surrogacy, even when perfectly true, do not generally have the desired interpretation as causal effects of treatment on outcome. We go on to formulate estimands based on principal stratification and principal causal effects and show their superiority.},

Cancer cases were also less likely than controls to have prior injuries from automobile accidents to the same degree (OR = 0.83; 95\% CI = 0.78\textendash 0.88). In the prospective cohort, there was a lower risk observed in cancer survivors, HR = 0.87 (95\% CI = 0.84\textendash 0.90). In contrast, there was no association between cancer diagnosis and subsequent automobile accident injuries (HR = 1.03; 95\% CI = 0.98\textendash 1.07). That cancer risks were similarly reduced after both AD and automobile injuries suggest biases against detecting cancer in persons with unrelated medical conditions. The modestly lower AD risk in cancer survivors may reflect underdiagnosis of AD in those with a serious illness. This study does not support a relationship between cancer and AD.},

  abstract = {The relationship between dementia and cancer is complex. A wealth of observational data suggest (1) reduced risk of certain cancers in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases; and (2) increased risk of other cancers in Parkinson disease. These relationships persist despite correcting for reporting artifacts and survival bias. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed and warrant further investigation. Aging is a risk factor for both. Common environmental exposures, such as smoking, may play roles. Common mechanisms such as chronic inflammation and immunosenescence, and common risk factors such as diabetes and obesity, have been implicated. Shared genetic pathways are a major focus, particularly those favoring apoptosis and cell proliferation at opposite ends of the spectrum. To complicate the picture further, certain cancer chemotherapy and adjuvant therapy agents have neurotoxic effects, whereas animal studies show other cancer drugs reducing neurodegeneration, raising the possibility of repurposing those agents for use in Alzheimer disease. These multiple potential lines of evidence must be disentangled to investigate underlying mechanisms, the end-game being to develop and to test potential prevention and treatment strategies.},

Neural precursor cell dysfunction and white matter dysfunction are thought to contribute to this debilitating syndrome. Here, we demonstrate persistent depletion of oligodendrocyte lineage cells in humans who received chemotherapy. Developing a mouse model of methotrexate chemotherapyinduced neurological dysfunction, we find a similar depletion of white matter OPCs, increased but incomplete OPC differentiation, and a persistent deficit in myelination. OPCs from chemotherapy-naive mice similarly exhibit increased differentiation when transplanted into the microenvironment of previously methotrexate-exposed brains, indicating an underlying microenvironmental perturbation. Methotrexate results in persistent activation of microglia and subsequent astrocyte activation that is dependent on inflammatory microglia. Microglial depletion normalizes oligodendroglial lineage dynamics, myelin microstructure, and cognitive behavior after methotrexate chemotherapy. These findings indicate that methotrexate chemotherapy exposure is associated with persistent tri-glial dysregulation and identify inflammatory microglia as a therapeutic target to abrogate chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment.},

  abstract = {Meaningful reductions in racial and ethnic inequities in chronic diseases of aging remain unlikely without major advancements in the inclusion of minoritized populations in aging research. While sparse, studies investigating research participation disparities have predominantly focused on individual-level factors and behavioral change, overlooking the influence of study design, structural factors, and social determinants of health on participation. This is also reflected in conventional practices that consistently fail to address established participation barriers, such as study requirements that impose financial, transportation, linguistic, and/or logistical barriers that disproportionately burden participants belonging to minoritized populations. These shortcomings not only risk exacerbating distrust toward research and researchers, but also introduce significant selection biases, diminishing our ability to detect differential mechanisms of risk, resilience, and response to interventions across subpopulations. This forum article examines the intersecting factors that drive both health inequities in aging and disparate participation in aging research among minoritized populations. Using an intersectional, social justice, and emancipatory lens, we characterize the role of social determinants, historical contexts, and contemporaneous structures in shaping research accessibility and inclusion. We also introduce frameworks to accelerate transformative theoretical approaches to fostering equitable inclusion of minoritized populations in aging research.},

These conditions include geographic segregation at the level of regions, metropolitan areas, and neighborhoods; intra- and inter-national migration patterns; socioeconomic position, including financial resources, and occupational and educational opportunities; discrimination; and group resources. Each of these exposures sets in course a cascade of individual mediators that ultimately manifest in neuropsychological outcomes. The physiological and behavioral consequences of these pathways likely accumulate across the lifecourse. We focus on cognitive aging, although the processes discussed here begin in infancy and likely influence cognitive outcomes throughout life from childhood into old age. A lifecourse framework can help inform clinical encounters, neuropsychological research, and surveillance regarding the population prevalence of cognitive impairments.},

  abstract = {Background: Cross-sectional reports suggest that statin users are less likely to have Alzheimer disease (AD). Prospective studies have provided inconsistent evidence. Moreover, it is unclear whether the association differs for lipohilic statins, those that could more easily pass the blood\textendash brain barrier and hydrophilic statins. Objectives: To prospectively evaluate whether use of statins is associated with the risk of AD, and to determine whether associations differ for lipophilic and hydrophilic statins. Method: 6992 participants of the prospective, population-based Rotterdam Study were followed, from baseline (1990\textendash 1993) until January 2005 for incident AD. Data on all filled prescriptions came from pharmacy records. For each date on which each event occurred, cholesterollowering drug use for the person who experienced the event and all remaining persons in the cohort was categorised as ``any'' or ``never'' use. A distinction was made between statin, lipophilic and hydrophilic statins, and non-statin cholesterol-lowering drugs. Data were analysed with the Cox regression analysis, adjusting for sex, age and potential confounders. Results: During follow-up (mean 9 years), 582 persons developed AD. Compared with never use of cholesterollowering drugs, statin use was associated with a decreased risk of AD (HR 0.57; 95\% CI 0.37 to 0.90), but non-statin cholesterol-lowering drug use was not (HR 1.05; 95\% CI 0.45 to 2.44). HRs were equal for lipophilic (HR 0.54; 95\% CI 0.32 to 0.89) and hydrophilic statins (HR 0.54; 95\% CI 0.26 to 1.11). Conclusion: In the general population, the use of statins, but not of non-statin cholesterol-lowering drugs, was associated with a lower risk of AD compared with never use of cholesterol-lowering drugs. The protective effect was independent of the lipophilicity of statins.},

This study seeks to improve our understanding of the association between cancer and the development of AD by showing how mortality selection alters this relationship. Method:\hspace{0.6em} A retrospective cohort study was carried out examining 92,425 individuals (47,873 women and 44,552 men) from the Utah Population Database with and without a history of any primary cancer identified by the Utah Cancer Registry. All individuals were aged 65\textendash 79 years and free of dementia in 1992 and followed for upwards of 18 years (1992\textendash 2009) for AD ascertainment, which was identified using diagnostic information from Medicare claims data. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We replicate previous results suggesting that cancer is associated with reduced risk of subsequent AD under specific statistical model specifications. However, these results should not be interpreted as evidence of an etiological association. We conclude that higher rates of overall mortality among individuals with cancer relative to those without cancer induce the widely reported putative protective association with cancer. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Careful consideration of model specification and the profound effects of mortality selection in the older adult population is essential when investigating the relationship between aging-related diseases such as cancer and AD. We show that cancer does not provide protection from AD as previously described in the literature. Social scientists seeking to understand social disparities in disease outcomes among older adults may therefore want to strongly consider the role of mortality selection which, if uncorrected, may generate biased associations.},

Purpose To review the shortcomings of intention-to-treat analyses, and of `as treated' and `per protocol' analyses as commonly implemented, with an emphasis on problems that are especially relevant for comparative effectiveness research. Methods and Results In placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials, intentionto-treat analyses underestimate the treatment effect and are therefore nonconservative for both safety trials and noninferiority trials. In randomized clinical trials with an active comparator, intention-to-treat estimates can overestimate a treatment's effect in the presence of differential adherence. In either case, there is no guarantee that an intention-to-treat analysis estimates the clinical effectiveness of treatment. Inverse probability weighting, g-estimation, and instrumental variable estimation can reduce the bias introduced by nonadherence and loss to follow-up in `as treated' and `per protocol' analyses. Limitations These analyse require untestable assumptions, a dose-response model, and time-varying data on confounders and adherence. Conclusions We recommend that all randomized clinical trials with substantial lack of adherence or loss to follow-up are analyzed using different methods. These include an intention-to-treat analysis to estimate the effect of assigned treatment and `as treated' and `per protocol' analyses to estimate the effect of treatment after appropriate adjustment via inverse probability weighting or g-estimation.

We describe examples of selection bias in casecontrol studies (eg, inappropriate selection of controls) and cohort studies (eg, informative censoring). We argue that the causal structure underlying the bias in each example is essentially the same: conditioning on a common effect of 2 variables, one of which is either exposure or a cause of exposure and the other is either the outcome or a cause of the outcome. This structure is shared by other biases (eg, adjustment for variables affected by prior exposure). A structural classification of bias distinguishes between biases resulting from conditioning on common effects (``selection bias'') and those resulting from the existence of common causes of exposure and outcome (``confounding''). This classification also leads to a unified approach to adjust for selection bias.},

This paper extends the usual counterfactual framework to consider causal questions about compound treatments for which there are many possible implementations (for example, ``prevention of obesity''). We describe the causal effect of compound treatments and their identifiability conditions, with a special emphasis on the consistency condition. We then discuss the challenges of using the estimated effect of a compound treatment in one study population to inform decisions in the same population and in other populations. These challenges arise because the causal effect of compound treatments depends on the distribution of the versions of treatment in the population. Such causal effects can be unpredictable when the versions of treatment are unknown. We discuss how such issues of ``transportability'' are related to the consistency condition in causal inference. With more carefully framed questions, the results of epidemiologic studies can be of greater value to decision-makers.},

Over the past 15 years, stratification-based techniques as well as methods such as inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation have been more prominently discussed and offered as a means to correct for selection bias. However, unlike correcting for confounding bias using inverse weighting, uptake of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation as well as competing methods has been limited in the applied epidemiologic literature. To motivate greater use of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation and competing methods, we use causal diagrams to describe the sources of selection bias in cohort studies employing a time-toevent framework when the quantity of interest is an absolute measure (e.g., absolute risk, survival function) or relative effect measure (e.g., risk difference, risk ratio). We highlight that whether a given estimate obtained from standard methods is potentially subject to selection bias depends on the causal diagram and the measure. We first broadly describe inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation and then give a simple example to demonstrate in detail how inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation mitigates selection bias and describe challenges to estimation. We then modify complex, real-world data from the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research HIV clinical cohort study and estimate the absolute and relative change in the occurrence of death with and without inverse probability-of-censoring weighted correction using the modified University of North Carolina data. We provide SAS code to aid with implementation of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted techniques.},

Unfortunately, such common causes are often unmeasured or poorly measured in racial health disparities studies. In the absence of accurate measures of the aforementioned common causes, redefining the target population or changing the study design represents a useful approach for reducing the extent of survival-related selection bias. To help researchers recognize and minimize survival-related selection bias in racial health disparities studies, we illustrate the aforementioned selection bias and how redefining the target population or changing the study design can be useful.},

DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION Search of PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL for randomized clinical trials published from database inception through December 31, 2019, that evaluated the association of blood pressure lowering on cognitive outcomes. The control groups consisted of either placebo, alternative antihypertensive agents, or higher blood pressure targets. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were screened and extracted independently by 2 authors. Random-effects meta-analysis models were used to report pooled treatment effects and CIs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was dementia or cognitive impairment. The secondary outcomes were cognitive decline and changes in cognitive test scores. RESULTS Fourteen randomized clinical trials were eligible for inclusion (96 158 participants), of which 12 reported the incidence of dementia (or composite of dementia and cognitive impairment [3 trials]) on follow-up and were included in the primary meta-analysis, 8 reported cognitive decline, and 8 reported changes in cognitive test scores. The mean (SD) age of trial participants was 69 (5.4) years and 40 617 (42.2\%) were women. The mean systolic baseline blood pressure was 154 (14.9) mm Hg and the mean diastolic blood pressure was 83.3 (9.9) mm Hg. The mean duration of follow-up was 49.2 months. Blood pressure lowering with antihypertensive agents compared with control was significantly associated with a reduced risk of dementia or cognitive impairment (12 trials; 92 135 participants) (7.0\% vs 7.5\% of patients over a mean trial follow-up of 4.1 years; odds ratio [OR], 0.93 [95\% CI, 0.88-0.98]; absolute risk reduction, 0.39\% [95\% CI, 0.09\%-0.68\%]; I2 = 0.0\%) and cognitive decline (8 trials) (20.2\% vs 21.1\% of participants over a mean trial follow-up of 4.1 years; OR, 0.93 [95\% CI, 0.88-0.99]; absolute risk reduction, 0.71\% [95\% CI, 0.19\%-1.2\%]; I2 = 36.1\%). Blood pressure lowering was not significantly associated with a change in cognitive test scores. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, blood pressure lowering with antihypertensive agents compared with control was significantly associated with a lower risk of incident dementia or cognitive impairment.},

  abstract = {There has been considerable interest in using decomposition methods in epidemiology (mediation analysis) and economics (Oaxaca\textendash Blinder decomposition) to understand how health disparities arise and how they might change upon intervention. It has not been clear when estimates from the Oaxaca\textendash Blinder decomposition can be interpreted causally because its implementation does not explicitly address potential confounding of target variables. While mediation analysis does explicitly adjust for confounders of target variables, it typically does so in a way that effectively entails equalizing confounders across racial groups, which may not reflect the intended intervention. Revisiting prior analyses in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth on disparities in wages, unemployment, incarceration, and overall health with test scores, taken as a proxy for educational attainment, as a target intervention, we propose and demonstrate a novel decomposition that controls for confounders of test scores (e.g., measures of childhood socioeconomic status [SES]) while leaving their association with race intact. We compare this decomposition with others that use standardization (to equalize childhood SES [the confounders] alone), mediation analysis (to equalize test scores within levels of childhood SES), and one that equalizes both childhood SES and test scores. We also show how these decompositions, including our novel proposals, are equivalent to implementations of the Oaxaca\textendash Blinder decomposition but provide a more formal causal interpretation for these decompositions.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A society's social structure and the interactions of its members determine when key drivers of health occur, for how long they last, and how they operate. Yet, it has been unclear whether causal inference methods can help us find meaningful interventions on these fundamental social drivers of health. Galea and Hern\'an propose we place hypothetical interventions on a spectrum and estimate their effects by emulating trials, either through individual-level data analysis or systems science modeling (Am J Epidemiol. 2020;189(3):167\textendash 170). In this commentary, by way of example in health disparities research, we probe this ``closer engagement of social epidemiology with formal causal inference approaches.'' The formidable, but not insurmountable, tensions call for causal reasoning and effect estimation in social epidemiology that should always be enveloped by a thorough understanding of how systems and the social exposome shape risk factor and health distributions. We argue that one way toward progress is a true partnership of social epidemiology and causal inference with bilateral feedback aimed at integrating social epidemiologic theory, causal identification and modeling methods, systems thinking, and improved study design and data. To produce consequential work, we must make social epidemiology more causal and causal inference more social.},

  abstract = {Causal decomposition analyses can help build the evidence base for interventions that address health disparities (inequities). They ask how disparities in outcomes may change under hypothetical intervention. Through study design and assumptions, they can rule out alternate explanations such as confounding, selection bias, and measurement error, thereby identifying potential targets for intervention. Unfortunately, the literature on causal decomposition analysis and related methods have largely ignored equity concerns that actual interventionists would respect, limiting their relevance and practical value. This article addresses these concerns by explicitly considering what covariates the outcome disparity and hypothetical intervention adjust for (so-called allowable covariates) and the equity value judgments these choices convey, drawing from the bioethics, biostatistics, epidemiology, and health services research literatures. From this discussion, we generalize decomposition estimands and formulae to incorporate allowable covariate sets (and thereby reflect equity choices) while still allowing for adjustment of non-allowable covariates needed to satisfy causal assumptions. For these general formulae, we provide weightingbased estimators based on adaptations of ratio-of-mediator-probability and inverse-odds-ratio weighting. We discuss when these estimators reduce to already used estimators under certain equity value judgments, and a novel adaptation under other judgments.},

There is currently no disease-modifying treatment though several symptomatic medications exist with modest benefit on cognition. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have a consistent benefit across all stages of dementia; their benefit in mild cognitive impairment and prodromal AD is unproven. Memantine has a smaller benefit on cognition overall which is limited to the moderate to severe stages, and the combination of a cholinesterase inhibitor and memantine may have additional efficacy. Evidence for the efficacy of vitamin E supplementation and medical foods is weak but might be considered in the context of cost, availability, and safety in individual patients. Apparently promising disease-modifying interventions, mostly addressing the amyloid cascade hypothesis of AD, have recently failed to demonstrate efficacy so novel approaches must be considered.},

When investigators design such studies, how important is it to follow patients from the day they initiated treatment with the study interventions? Our article considers this question and related issues to start a dialogue on the value of the incident user design in comparative effectiveness research. By incident user design, we mean a study that sets the cohort's inception date according to patients' new use of an intervention. In contrast, most epidemiologic studies enroll patients who were currently or recently using an intervention when follow-up began. We take the incident user design as a reasonable default strategy because it reduces biases that can impact non-randomized studies, especially when investigators use healthcare databases. We review case studies where investigators have explored the consequences of designing a cohort study by restricting to incident users, but most of the discussion has been informed by expert opinion, not by systematic evidence.

  abstract = {Causal inference', in 21st century epidemiology, has notably come to stand for a specific approach, one focused primarily on counterfactual and potential outcome reasoning and using particular representations, such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and Bayesian causal nets. In this essay, we suggest that in epidemiology no one causal approach should drive the questions asked or delimit what counts as useful evidence. Robust causal inference instead comprises a complex narrative, created by scientists appraising, from diverse perspectives, different strands of evidence produced by myriad methods. DAGs can of course be useful, but should not alone wag the causal tale. To make our case, we first address key conceptual issues, after which we offer several concrete examples illustrating how the newly favoured methods, despite their strengths, can also: (i) limit who and what may be deemed a `cause', thereby narrowing the scope of the field; and (ii) lead to erroneous causal inference, especially if key biological and social assumptions about parameters are poorly conceived, thereby potentially causing harm. As an alternative, we propose that the field of epidemiology consider judicious use of the broad and flexible framework of `inference to the best explanation', an approach perhaps best developed by Peter Lipton, a philosopher of science who frequently employed epidemiologically relevant examples. This stance requires not only that we be open to being pluralists about both causation and evidence but also that we rise to the challenge of forging explanations that, in Lipton's words, aspire to `scope, precision, mechanism, unification and simplicity'.},

  abstract = {Several epidemiological studies show an inverse association between cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is debated whether this association is the consequence of biological mechanisms shared by both these conditions or may be related to the pharmacological treatments carried out on the patients. The latter hypothesis, however, is not sustained by the available evidence. Hence, the focus of this review is to analyze common biological mechanisms for both cancer and AD and to build up a biological theory useful to explain the inverse correlation between AD and cancer. The review proposes a hypothesis, according to which several molecular players, prominently PIN1 and p53, have been investigated and considered involved in complex molecular interactions putatively associated with the inverse correlation. On the other hand, p53 involvement in both diseases seems to be a consequence of the aberrant activation of other proteins. Instead, PIN1 may be identified as a novel key regulator at the crossroad between cancer and AD. PIN1 is a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase that catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization, thus regulating the conformation of different protein substrates after phosphorylation and modulating protein function. In particular, trans-conformations of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and tau are functional and ``healthy'', while cis-conformations, triggered after phosphorylation, are pathogenic. As an example, PIN1 accelerates APP cis-to-trans isomerization thus favoring the non-amyloidogenic pathway, while, in the absence of PIN1, APP is processed through the amyloidogenic pathway, thus predisposing to neurodegeneration. Furthermore, a link between PIN1 and tau regulation has been found, since when PIN1 function is inhibited, tau is hyperphosphorylated. Data from brain specimens of subjects affected by mild cognitive impairment and AD have revealed a very low PIN1 expression. Moreover, polymorphisms in PIN1 promoter correlated with an increased PIN1 expression are associated with a delay of sporadic AD age of onset, while a polymorphism related to a reduced PIN1 expression is associated with a decreased risk of multiple cancers. In the case of dementias, in particular of Alzheimer's disease, new biological markers and targets based on the discussed players can be developed based on a theoretical approach relying on different grounds compared to the past. An unbiased expansion of the rationale and of the targets may help to achieve in the field of neurodegenerative dementias similar advances to those attained in the case of cancer treatment.},

  abstract = {Background: Published in 2019, a new addendum to the ICH E9 guideline presents the estimand framework as a systematic approach to ensure alignment among clinical trial objectives, trial execution/conduct, statistical analyses, and interpretation of results. The use of the estimand framework for describing clinical trial objectives has yet to be extensively considered in the context of patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We discuss the application of the estimand framework to PRO objectives when designing clinical trials in the future, with a focus on PRO outcomes in oncology trial settings as our example. Main: We describe the components of an estimand and take a na\"ive PRO trial objective to illustrate how to apply attributes described in the estimand framework to inform construction of a detailed clinical trial objective and its related estimand. We discuss identifying potential post-randomization events that alter the interpretation of the endpoint or render its observation impossible (also defined as intercurrent events) in the context of PRO endpoints, and the implications of how to handle intercurrent events in the construction of the PRO objective. Using a simple objective statement, ``What is the effect of treatment X on patient's quality of life?'', we build up an example estimand statement and also use a previously published phase III oncology clinical trial to illustrate how an estimand for a PRO objective could have been written to align to the estimate framework. Conclusion: The use of the estimand framework, as described in the new ICH E9 (R1) addendum guideline will become a key common framework for developing clinical trial objectives for evaluating effects of treatment. In the context of considering PROs, the framework provides an opportunity to more precisely specify and build the rationale for patient-focused objectives. This will help to ensure that clinical trials used for registration are designed and analysed appropriately, enabling all stakeholders to accurately interpret conclusions about the treatment effects for patient-focused outcomes.},

The Rotterdam Study is a prospective population-based cohort study ongoing since 1990 in the city of Rotterdam, The Netherlands. One of the main targets of the Rotterdam Study is to identify the determinants and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases. Case finding in epidemiological studies is strongly depending on various sources of follow-up and clear outcome definitions. The sources used for collection of data in the Rotterdam Study are diverse and the definitions of outcomes in the Rotterdam Study have changed due to the introduction of novel diagnostics and therapeutic interventions. This article gives the methods for data collection and the up-to-date definitions of the cardiac outcomes based on international guidelines, including the recently adopted cardiovascular disease mortality definitions. In all, detailed description of cardiac outcome definitions enhances the possibility to make comparisons with other studies in the field of cardiovascular research and may increase the strength of collaborations.}

  abstract = {Objective: To assess the association between statin therapy and risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) in a prospective cohort study with documented statin exposure and incident dementia. Methods: This is a prospective, cohort study of statin use and incident dementia and probable AD. A cohort of 2,356 cognitively intact persons, aged 65 and older, were randomly selected from a health maintenance organization (HMO), and were assessed biennially for dementia. Statin use was identified using the HMO pharmacy database. A proportional hazards model with statin use as a time-dependent covariate was used to assess the statin\textendash{} dementia/AD association. Results: Among 312 participants with incident dementia, 168 had probable AD. The unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with statin use were 1.33 (95\% CI 0.95 to 1.85) for all-cause dementia and 0.90 (CI 0.54 to 1.51) for probable AD. Adjusted corresponding HRs were 1.19 (CI 0.82 to 1.75) and 0.82 (CI 0.46 to 1.46). A subgroup analysis of participants with at least one APOE-⑀4 allele who entered the study before age 80 produced an adjusted HR of 0.33 (CI 0.10 to 1.04). Conclusion: Employing time-dependent proportional hazards modeling, the authors found no significant association between statin use and incident dementia or probable AD. In contrast, when the data were analyzed, inappropriately, as a case-control study, the authors found an OR of 0.55 for probable AD, falsely indicating a protective effect of statins. Study design and analytic methods may explain the discrepancy between the current null findings and earlier findings.},

To illustrate our approach, we compared estimates of the effect of immediate with deferred initiation of antiretroviral therapy in individuals positive for the human immunodeficiency virus from the Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Therapy (START) randomized trial and the observational HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration.},

  abstract = {Background: Guidance reports for observational comparative effectiveness and drug safety research recommend implementing a new-user design whenever possible, since it reduces the risk of selection bias in exposure effect estimation compared to a prevalent-user design. The uptake of this guidance has not been studied extensively. Methods: We reviewed 89 observational effectiveness and safety cohort studies published in six pharmacoepidemiological journals in 2018 and 2019. We developed an extraction tool to assess how frequently new-user and prevalent-user designs were reported to be implemented. For studies that implemented a new-user design in both treatment arms, we extracted information about the extent to which the moment of meeting eligibility criteria, treatment initiation, and start of follow-up were reported to be aligned. Results: Of the 89 studies included, 40\% reported implementing a new-user design for both the study exposure arm and the comparator arm, while 13\% reported implementing a prevalent-user design in both arms. The moment of meeting eligibility criteria, treatment initiation, and start of follow-up were reported to be aligned in both treatment arms in 53\% of studies that reported implementing a new-user design. We provided examples of studies that minimized the risk of introducing bias due to unclear definition of time origin in unexposed participants, immortal time, or a time lag. Conclusions: Almost half of the included studies reported implementing a new-user design. Implications of misalignment of study design origin were difficult to assess because it would require explicit reporting of the target estimand in original studies. We recommend that the choice for a particular study time origin is explicitly motivated to enable assessment of validity of the study.},

One influential development has been the Bactive comparator, new user\^ study design, which seeks to emulate the design of a head-tohead randomized controlled trial. In this review, we first discuss biases that may affect pharmacoepidemiologic studies and describe their direction and magnitude in a variety of settings. We then present the historical foundations of the active comparator, new user study design and explain how this design conceptually mitigates biases leading to a paradigm shift in pharmacoepidemiology. We offer practical guidance on the implementation of the study design using administrative databases. Finally, we provide an empirical example in which the active comparator, new user study design addresses biases that have previously impeded pharmacoepidemiologic studies.},

Studies were identified by searching PubMed database through 1966 to December 2013 using the terms ``Alzheimer's disease'', ``neoplasm'', and ``cancer''. Six studies met the inclusion criteria in the overall meta-analysis. We pooled effect sizes using fixed-effects and random-effects models. Furthermore, we also tested for heterogeneity and publication bias. The results suggested that individuals diagnosed with AD had a decreased risk for incident cancer by 42\% (95\% CI, 0.40\textendash 0.86; p {$<$} 0.05), and patients with a history of cancer had a 37\% decreased risk of AD (RR = 0.63; 95\% CI, 0.56\textendash 0.72; p = 0.495). The Egger's test for publication bias (p = 0.280) showed no significant evidence for bias in the data from studies on AD and cancer risk. In summary, our meta-analysis demonstrated an inverse association between cancer and AD.},

  abstract = {Methods Data were obtained from the PHARMO-database, comprising pharmacy records of approximately 300 000 people in The Netherlands. In the period from 1991\textendash 98, we estimated prevalence of lipid lowering drug use on the first Wednesday of October. A patient was defined as incident user if (s)he filled a prescription for lipid lowering medication after a 360 days lipid lowering drug free interval. Both prevalence and incidence estimates were weighted for the sex and age distribution of the general Dutch population. Results From 1991 to 1998, the prevalence of lipid lowering drug use increased from 0.5\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.5, 0.6) to 2.3\% (95\% CI: 2.2, 2.4) in women and from 0.6\% (95\% CI: 0.6, 0.6) to 2.9\% (95\% CI: 2.8, 3.0) in men. Prevalence increased with increasing age and was highest in the age category 60\textendash 69 years (in 1998: 9.9\% (95\% CI: 9.4, 10.4) in women and 11.6\% (95\% CI: 11.0, 12.1) in men). In 1992, the estimated incidence of lipid lowering drug use was 251(95\% CI: 226, 277)/100 000 person years in women and 251(95\% CI: 225, 276)/100 000 person years in men. The largest incidence estimates were observed in 1996 (685(95\% CI: 644, 726)/ 100 000 person years in women and 881(95\% CI: 834, 928)/100 000 person years in men). After 1996, incidence stabilized in 1997 and decreased in 1998 to 599(561, 637)/100 000 person years in women and 731(688, 773)/100 000 person years in men. Most of the patients (approximately 95\%) were treated with one lipid lowering agent. Statins were used by over 90\% of patients from 1996 onwards. In 1998, 35\% of the patients started with a statin that was not a first choice drug (mainly atorvastatin). Conclusions In the period from 1991\textendash 98, prevalence of lipid lowering drug use significantly increased in The Netherlands. However, incidence stabilized and decreased after 1996 which may be explained by the fact that the number of patients eligible for treatment was reached. The question remains whether lipid lowering medication was targeted to the appropriate patients.},

  abstract = {Acquiring real-world evidence is crucial to support health policy, but observational studies are prone to serious biases. An approach was recently proposed to overcome confounding and immortal-time biases within the emulated trial framework. This tutorial provides a step-by-step description of the design and analysis of emulated trials, as well as R and Stata code, to facilitate its use in practice. The steps consist in: (i) specifying the target trial and inclusion criteria; (ii) cloning patients; (iii) defining censoring and survival times; (iv) estimating the weights to account for informative censoring introduced by design; and (v) analysing these data. These steps are illustrated with observational data to assess the benefit of surgery among 70\textendash 89-year-old patients diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer. Because of the severe unbalance of the patient characteristics between treatment arms (surgery yes/no), a na\textasciidieresis\i ve Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the initial cohort severely overestimated the benefit of surgery on 1-year survival (22\% difference), as did a survival analysis of the cloned dataset when informative censoring was ignored (17\% difference). By contrast, the estimated weights adequately removed the covariate imbalance. The weighted analysis still showed evidence of a benefit, though smaller (11\% difference), of surgery among older lung cancer patients on 1-year survival. Complementing the CERBOT tool, this tutorial explains how to proceed to conduct emulated trials using observational data in the presence of immortal-time bias. The strength of this approach is its transparency and its principles that are easily understandable by non-specialists.},

  abstract = {Background: The relationship between education and late-life cognitive decline is controversial. Selective survival between early life, when education is typically completed, and late life, when cognitive ageing studies take place, could attenuate effect estimates. Methods: We quantified potential survival bias (collider-stratification bias) in estimation of the effect of education on late-life cognitive decline by simulating hypothetical cohorts of 20-year-olds and applying cumulative mortality from US life tables. For each of four causal scenarios (2000 replications each), we compared the estimated versus causal effect of education on cognitive decline over 9 years, starting at age 60, 75 or 90 in random samples of n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2000 people who survived to each age. Results: Effects of education on cognitive decline were underestimated when both education and U, another determinant of cognitive decline, influenced mortality (colliderstratification bias). The magnitude of bias was sensitive to the magnitude of the effect of U on cognitive decline and whether there was a multiplicative interaction between education and U on mortality. For example, when there was a multiplicative interaction between education and U on mortality, 95\% confidence interval coverage of the causal effect ranged from 83.4\% to 50.4\% at age 60 and 25.8\% to 0.2\% at age 90. Conclusions: Selective survival could lead to underestimation of effects of education on late-life cognitive decline. Our simulations map survival bias to testable assumptions about underlying causal structures.},

The effectiveness of these implementation strategies is often context-dependent and reconciling the desire to produce generalizable knowledge in the face of these contextual interventions is a central challenge for implementation science researchers. Methods: We provide an overview of the causal transportability theory and conceptualize context under this framework. We review how causal graphs can be used to illustrate the assumptions necessary to apply the results of a study to a new context, and we illustrate this approach using an example of a community adherence group intervention that aims to improve retention in HIV care. Finally, we discuss several key insights highlighted by the transportability theory that are relevant to implementation science researchers. Results: By adopting causal transportability to consider how context may affect the success of an implementation strategy, researchers can formally diagnose when the results of a study are likely to generalize to a given setting. Moreover, selection diagrams can highlight what additional measurements would be needed in a target population to estimate the effect of an implementation strategy in that target population without having to repeat the initial study. Conclusions: Transportability translates intuition about contextdependent interventions and external validity into actionable and testable insight.},

Our results demonstrate the impact of race, cancer type, age and time since cancer diagnosis on the risk of AD death in cancer patients. While the risk of AD death was decreased in white patients diagnosed with various cancers at 45 or more years of age, it was increased in black patients diagnosed with cancers before 45 years of age (likely due to early onset AD). Chemotherapy decreased the risk of AD death in white women diagnosed with BC at the age of 65 or more, however radiotherapy displayed a more complex pattern with early decrease and late increase in the risk of AD death during a prolonged time interval after the treatment. Our data point to links between molecular mechanisms involved in cancer and AD, and to the potential applicability of some anti-cancer treatments against AD.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Pragmatic randomized trials are important tools for shared decision-making, but no guidance exists on patients' preferences for types of causal information. We aimed to assess preferences of patients and investigators toward causal effects in pragmatic randomized trials. Study Design and Setting: We (a) held three focus groups with patients (n 5 23) in Boston, MA; (b) surveyed (n 5 12) and interviewed (n 5 5) investigators with experience conducting pragmatic trials; and (c) conducted a systematic literature review of pragmatic trials (n 5 63). Results: Patients were distrustful of new-to-market medications unless substantially more effective than existing choices, preferred stratified absolute risks, and valued adherence-adjusted analyses when they expected to adhere. Investigators wanted both intention-totreat and per-protocol effects but felt methods for estimating per-protocol effects were lacking. When estimating per-protocol effects, many pragmatic trials used inappropriate methods to adjust for adherence and loss to follow-up. Conclusion: We made four recommendations for pragmatic trials to improve patient centeredness: (1) focus on superiority in effectiveness or safety, rather than noninferiority; (2) involve patients in specifying a priori subgroups; (3) report absolute measures of risk; and (4) complement intention-to-treat effect estimates with valid per-protocol effect estimates. \'O 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: This was a cohort study in Northern Italy on more than 1 million residents. Cancer incidence was derived from the local health authority (ASL-Mi1) tumor registry and AD dementia incidence from registries of drug prescriptions, hospitalizations, and payment exemptions. Expected cases of AD dementia were calculated by applying the age-, sex-, and calendar year\textendash specific incidence rates observed in the whole population to the subgroup constituted of persons with newly diagnosed cancers during the observation period (2004\textendash 2009). The same calculations were carried out for cancers in patients with AD dementia. Separate analyses were carried out for the time period preceding or following the index diagnosis for survivors and nonsurvivors until the end of 2009 and for different types and sites of cancer. Results: The risk of cancer in patients with AD dementia was halved, and the risk of AD dementia in patients with cancer was 35\% reduced. This relationship was observed in almost all subgroup analyses, suggesting that some anticipated potential confounding factors did not significantly influence the results. Conclusions: The occurrence of both cancer and AD dementia increases exponentially with age, but with an inverse relationship; older persons with cancer have a reduced risk of AD dementia and vice versa. As AD dementia and cancer are negative hallmarks of aging and senescence, we suggest that AD dementia, cancer, and senescence could be manifestations of a unique phenomenon related to human aging.

Methods: We systematically studied 199,721 participants in 92 placebo-controlled and active-comparator trials comparing atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin in participants with, or at risk of developing, cardiovascular disease. We performed pairwise and network meta-analyses for major coronary events and all-cause mortality outcomes, taking into account the dose differences across trials. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO 2011:CRD42011001470. Results: There were only a few trials that evaluated fluvastatin. Most frequent comparisons occurred between pravastatin and placebo, atorvastatin and placebo, and rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. No trial directly compared all six statins to each other. Across all populations, statins were significantly more effective than control in reducing all-cause mortality (OR 0.87, 95\% credible interval 0.82\textendash 0.92) and major coronary events (OR 0.69, 95\% CI 0.64\textendash 0.75). In terms of reducing major coronary events, atorvastatin (OR 0.66, 95\% CI 0.48\textendash 0.94) and fluvastatin (OR 0.59, 95\% CI 0.36\textendash 0.95) were significantly more effective than rosuvastatin at comparable doses. In participants with cardiovascular disease, statins significantly reduced deaths (OR 0.82, 95\% CI 0.75\textendash 0.90) and major coronary events (OR 0.69, 95\% CI 0.62\textendash 0.77). Atorvastatin was significantly more effective than pravastatin (OR 0.65, 95\% CI 0.43\textendash 0.99) and simvastatin (OR 0.68, 95\% CI 0.38\textendash 0.98) for secondary prevention of major coronary events. In primary prevention, statins significantly reduced deaths (OR 0.91, 95\% CI 0.83\textendash 0.99) and major coronary events (OR 0.69, 95\% CI 0.61\textendash 0.79) with no differences among individual statins. Across all populations, atorvastatin (80\%), fluvastatin (79\%), and simvastatin (62\%) had the highest overall probability of being the best treatment in terms of both outcomes. Higher doses of atorvastatin and fluvastatin had the highest number of significant differences in preventing major coronary events compared with other statins. No significant heterogeneity or inconsistency was detected. Conclusions: Statins significantly reduce the incidence of all-cause mortality and major coronary events as compared to control in both secondary and primary prevention. This analysis provides evidence for potential differences between individual statins, which are not fully explained by their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-reducing effects. The observed differences between statins should be investigated in future prospective studies.},

The methodology described utilizes information obtained from observed cancer incidence to reconstruct what is cautiously believed to be the period of time from malignant cancer initiation to diagnosis. Analyses show a decreasing hazard for cancer indicating that the longer a patient survives, the more likely they are to reach the upper limit of their natural lifespan. Based on previous research, the Weibull distribution has been used to describe the mechanisms of cancer development. In contrast to the memoryless exponential distribution which assumes a constant failure rate, the shape of the Weibull distribution is dependent on past events and preserves a memory of prior survival. This provides a simple but powerful way to characterize how the unobserved experience of cancer relates to the observed as a function to estimate the time between onset and diagnosis. The results indicate a window of opportunity for early intervention when cancer is most treatable. The method presented provides useful information to identify cancers with high mortality and prolonged periods of undetected growth to distinguish types of dire public health concern.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological studies show a reciprocal inverse association between cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The common mechanistic theory for this effect posits that cells have an innate tendency toward apoptotic or survival pathways, translating to increased risk for either neurodegeneration or cancer. However, it has been shown that cancer patients experience cognitive dysfunction pre- and post-treatment as well as alterations in cerebral gray matter density (GMD) on MRI. To further investigate these issues, we analyzed the association between cancer history (CA{$\pm$}) and age of AD onset, and the relationship between GMD and CA{$\pm$} status across diagnostic groups in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort study. Data was analyzed from 1609 participants with information on baseline cancer history and AD diagnosis, age of AD onset, and baseline MRI scans. Participants were CA+ (N = 503) and CA- (N = 1106) diagnosed with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), significant memory concerns (SMC), and cognitively normal older adults. As in previous studies, CA+ was inversely associated with AD at baseline (P = 0.025); interestingly, this effect appears to be driven by nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), the largest cancer category in this study (P = 0.001). CA+ was also associated with later age of AD onset (P {$<$} 0.001), independent of apolipoprotein E (APOE) {$\epsilon$}4 allele status, and individuals with two prior cancers had later mean age of AD onset than those with one or no prior cancer (P {$<$} 0.001), suggesting an additive effect. Voxel-based morphometric analysis of GMD showed CA+ had lower GMD in the right superior frontal gyrus compared to CA- across diagnostic groups (Pcrit {$<$} 0.001, uncorrected); this cluster of lower GMD appeared to be driven by history of invasive cancer types, rather than skin cancer. Thus, while cancer history is associated with a measurable delay in AD onset independent of APOE {$\epsilon$}4, the underlying mechanism does not appear to be cancer-related preservation of GMD.},

This lack of progress may be partially attributable to disease heterogeneity. Previous studies have identified an inverse association of cancer and AD, suggesting that cancer history may be one source of AD heterogeneity. These findings are particularly interesting in light of the number of common risk factors and two-hit models hypothesized to commonly drive both diseases. We reviewed the ten hallmark biological alterations of cancer cells to investigate overlap with the AD literature and identified overlap of all ten hallmarks in AD, including (1) potentially common underlying risk factors, such as increased inflammation, deregulated cellular energetics, and genome instability; (2) inversely regulated mechanisms, including cell death and evading growth suppressors; and (3) functions with more complex, pleiotropic mechanisms, some of which may be stagedependent in AD, such as cell adhesion/contact inhibition and angiogenesis. Additionally, we discuss the recent observation of a biological link between cancer and AD neuropathology. Finally, we address the therapeutic implications of this topic. The significant overlap of functional pathways and molecules between these diseases, some similarly and some oppositely regulated or functioning in each disease, supports the need for more research to elucidate cancer-related AD genetic and functional heterogeneity, with the aims of better understanding AD risk mediators, as well as further exploring the potential for some types of drug repurposing towards AD therapeutic development.},

  abstract = {Background and purpose Both stroke and obesity show an increasing incidence worldwide. While obesity is an established risk factor for stroke, its influence on outcome in ischemic stroke is less clear. Many studies suggest a better prognosis in obese patients after stroke (``obesity paradox''). This review aims at assessing the clinical outcomes of obese patients after stroke by performing a systematic literature search. Methods The reviewers searched MEDLINE from inception to December 2015. Studies were eligible if they included outcome comparisons in stroke patients with allocation to body weight. Results Twenty-five studies (299'750 patients) were included and none was randomised. Ten of 12 studies (162'921 patients) reported significantly less mortality rates in stroke patients with higher BMI values. Seven of 9 studies (92'718 patients) ascertained a favorable effect of excess body weight on non-fatal outcomes (good clinical outcome, recurrence of vascular events). Six studies (85'042 patients) indicated contradictory results after intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), however. Several methodological limitations were observed in major part of studies (observational study design, inaccuracy of BMI in reflecting obesity, lacking body weight measurement, selection bias, survival bias). Conclusion Most observational data indicate a survival benefit of obese patients after stroke, but a number of methodological concerns exist. No obesity paradox was observed in patients after IVT. There is a need for well-designed randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of weight reduction on stroke risk in obese patients.},

  abstract = {Cognitive changes are common in patients with active cancer and during its remission. This has largely been blamed on therapy-related toxicities and diagnosis-related stress, with little attention paid to the biological impact of cancer itself. A plethora of clinical studies demonstrates that cancer patients experience cognitive impairment during and after treatment. However, recent studies show that a significant portion of patients with non-central nervous system (CNS) tumors experience cognitive decline prior to treatment, suggesting a role for tumor-derived factors in modulating cognition and behavior. Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) negatively impacts a patient's quality of life, reduces occupational and social functioning, and increases morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, patients with cancer cachexia frequently experience a stark neurocognitive decline, suggesting peripheral tumors exert an enduring toll on the brain during this chronic paraneoplastic syndrome. However, the scarcity of research on cognitive impairment in non-CNS cancers makes it difficult to isolate psychosocial, genetic, behavioral, and pathophysiological factors in CRCI. Furthermore, clinical models of CRCI are frequently confounded by complicated drug regimens that inherently affect neurocognitive processes. The severity of CRCI varies considerably amongst patients and highlights its multifactorial nature. Untangling the biological aspects of CRCI from genetic, psychosocial, and behavioral factors is non-trivial, yet vital in understanding the pathogenesis of CRCI and discovering means for therapeutic intervention. Recent evidence demonstrating the ability of peripheral tumors to alter CNS pathways in murine models is compelling, and it allows researchers to isolate the underlying biological mechanisms from the confounding psychosocial stressors found in the clinic. This review summarizes the state of the science of CRCI independent of treatment and focuses on biological mechanisms in which peripheral cancers modulate the CNS.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To compare long-term memory trajectories before and after incident cancer with memory trajectories of similarly aged individuals not diagnosed with cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based cohort study included 14 583 US adults born before 1949 with no cancer history from the Health and Retirement Study. Biennial assessments were performed for up to 16 years from 1998 to 2014. Data analysis was performed from January 8 to October 5, 2018. EXPOSURES Self-reported physician diagnosis of any cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) during follow-up. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A composite memory score standardized to a mean (SD) of 0 (1) at baseline was based on immediate and delayed word-list recall and proxy assessments. The rate of memory change among people diagnosed with cancer during follow-up before and after diagnosis was compared with rate of memory change in individuals who remained cancer free during follow-up using linear mixed-effect models with random intercepts and slopes. RESULTS A total of 14 583 participants were included in the sample (mean [SD] age, 66.4 [10.4] years; 8453 [58.0\%] female). The mean (SD) follow-up was 11.5 (5.1) years; 2250 had a cancer diagnosis during follow-up, and 12 333 had no cancer diagnosis during follow-up. The rate of memory decline in the decade before a cancer diagnosis was 10.5\% (95\% CI, 6.2\%-14.9\%), which was slower than memory decline in similarly aged cancer-free individuals. For individuals diagnosed at 75 years of age, mean memory function immediately before diagnosis was 0.096 SD units (95\% CI, 0.0600.133 SD units) higher compared with that among similarly aged cancer-free individuals. A new cancer diagnosis was associated with a short-term decline in memory of -0.058 (95\% CI, -0.084 to -0.032) SD units compared with memory before diagnosis. After diagnosis, the rate of memory decline was 3.9\% (95\% CI, 0.9\%-6.9\%) slower in individuals with cancer than in those without a cancer diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, older individuals who developed cancer had better memory and slower memory decline than did similarly aged individuals who remained cancer free. These findings support the possibility of a common pathologic process working in opposite directions in cancer and Alzheimer disease.},

  abstract = {Neurodegenerative disorders and cancer may appear unrelated illnesses. Yet, epidemiologic studies indicate an inverse correlation between their respective incidences for specific cancers. Possibly explaining these findings, increasing evidence indicates that common molecular pathways are involved, often in opposite manner, in the pathogenesis of both disease families. Genetic mutations in the MAPT gene encoding for TAU protein cause an inherited form of frontotemporal dementia, a neurodegenerative disorder, but also increase the risk of developing cancer. Assigning TAU at the interface between cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, two major aging-linked disease families, offers a possible clue for the epidemiological observation inversely correlating these human illnesses. In addition, the expression level of TAU is recognized as a prognostic marker for cancer, as well as a modifier of cancer resistance to chemotherapy. Because of its microtubule-binding properties, TAU may interfere with the mechanism of action of taxanes, a class of chemotherapeutic drugs designed to stabilize the microtubule network and impair cell division. Indeed, a low TAU expression is associated to a better response to taxanes. Although TAU main binding partners are microtubules, TAU is able to relocate to subcellular sites devoid of microtubules and is also able to bind to cancer-linked proteins, suggesting a role of TAU in modulating microtubule-independent cellular pathways associated to oncogenesis. This concept is strengthened by experimental evidence linking TAU to P53 signaling, DNA stability and protection, processes that protect against cancer. This review aims at collecting literature data supporting the association between TAU and cancer. We will first summarize the evidence linking neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, then published data supporting a role of TAU as a modifier of the efficacy of chemotherapies and of the oncogenic process. We will finish by addressing from a mechanistic point of view the role of TAU in de-regulating critical cancer pathways, including the interaction of TAU with cancer-associated proteins.},

  abstract = {Objective: To establish whether initiation of treatment with diuretic or {$\beta$} blocker is associated over 54 months with change in cognitive function. Design: A cognitive substudy, nested within a randomised, placebo controlled, single blind trial. Setting: 226 general practices from the Medical Research Council's general practice research framework. Subjects: A subset of 2584 subjects sequentially recruited from among the 4396 participants aged 65-74 in the trial of treatment of hypertension in older adults. The 4396 subjects were randomised to receive diuretic, {$\beta$} blocker, or placebo. Subjects had mean systolic pressures of 160-209 mm Hg and mean diastolic pressures \&lt;115 mm Hg during an eight week run in. Outcome measures: The rate of change in paired associate learning test (PALT) and trail making test part A (TMT) scores (administered at entry and at 1, 9, 21, and 54 months) over time. Results: There was no difference in the mean learning test coefficients (rate of change of score over time) between the three treatments: diuretic -0.31 (95\% confidence interval -0.23 to -0.39), {$\beta$} blocker -0.33 (-0.25 to -0.41), placebo -0.30, (-0.24 to -0.36). There was also no difference in the mean trail making coefficients (rate of change in time taken to complete over time) between the three groups: diuretic -2.73 (95\% confidence interval -3.57 to -1.88), {$\beta$} blocker -2.08 (-3.29 to -0.87), placebo -3.01, (-3.69 to -2.32). A less conservative protocol analysis confirmed this negative finding. Conclusion: Treating moderate hypertension in older people is unlikely to influence, for better or for worse, subsequent cognitive function. Key messages Key messagesStudies have shown that treating hypertension in older adults reduces cardiovascular mortality and morbidityTreating moderate hypertension with either diuretic or {$\beta$} blocker does not seem to influence cognitive functionConcerns about damaging cognition should not deter doctors from treating hypertension in older patientsAge should no longer be a factor in the decision to initiate antihypertensive treatment}

A total of 54 incident cases of AD/PD and 347 cancer cases were matched with 216 and 667 controls, respectively. After controlling for low education, obesity, history of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, physical activity, smoking habit, alcohol consumption, and dietary habit, cancer was found inversely associated with the risk of AD/PD (OR, 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.32-1.38), and the risk of cancer in AD/PD was similarly reduced (OR, 0.42; 95\% CI, 0.20-0.91).

This study aimed to determine whether blood pressure lowering would reduce the risks of dementia and cognitive decline among individuals with cerebrovascular disease.The Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 6105 people with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack. Participants were assigned to either active treatment (perindopril for all participants and indapamide for those with neither an indication for nor a contraindication to a diuretic) or matching placebo(s). The primary outcomes for these analyses were dementia (using DSM-IV criteria) and cognitive decline (a decline of 3 or more points in the Mini-Mental State Examination score).During a mean follow-up of 3.9 years, dementia was documented in 193 (6.3\%) of the 3051 randomized participants in the actively treated group and 217 (7.1\%) of the 3054 randomized participants in the placebo group (relative risk reduction, 12\% [95\% confidence interval, -8\% to 28\%]; P = .2). Cognitive decline occurred in 9.1\% of the actively treated group and 11.0\% of the placebo group (risk reduction, 19\% [95\% confidence interval, 4\% to 32\%]; P = .01). The risks of the composite outcomes of dementia with recurrent stroke and of cognitive decline with recurrent stroke were reduced by 34\% (95\% confidence interval, 3\% to 55\%) (P = .03) and 45\% (95\% confidence interval, 21\% to 61\%) (P\&lt;.001), respectively, with no clear effect on either dementia or cognitive decline in the absence of recurrent stroke.Active treatment was associated with reduced risks of dementia and cognitive decline associated with recurrent stroke. These findings further support the recommendation that blood pressure lowering with perindopril and indapamide therapy be considered for all patients with cerebrovascular disease.Arch Intern Med. 2003;163:1069-1075--{$>$}}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine racial and ethnic differences in recruitment methods and trial eligibility in a multisite preclinical AD trial. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study analyzed screening data from the Anti-Amyloid in Asymptomatic AD study, collected from April 2014 to December 2017. Participants were categorized into 5 mutually exclusive ethnic/racial groups (ie, Hispanic, Black, White, Asian, and other) using participant self-report. Data were analyzed from May through December 2020 and included 5945 cognitively unimpaired older adults between the ages of 65 and 85 years screened at North American study sites. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes included recruitment sources, study eligibility, and ineligibility reasons. To assess the probability of trial eligibility, regression analyses were performed for the likelihood of being eligible after the first screening visit involving clinical and cognitive assessments. RESULTS Screening data were included for 5945 participants at North American sites (mean [SD] age, 71.7 [4.9] years; 3524 women [59.3\%]; 5107 White [85.9\%], 323 Black [5.4\%], 261 Hispanic [4.4\%], 112 Asian [1.9\%], and 142 [2.4\%] who reported race or ethnicity as other). Recruitment sources differed by race and ethnicity. While White participants were recruited through a variety of sources, site local recruitment efforts resulted in the majority of Black (218 [69.2\%]), Hispanic (154 [59.7\%]), and Asian (61 [55.5\%]) participants. Participants from underrepresented groups had lower mean years of education (eg, mean [SD] years: Hispanic participants, 15.5 [3.2] years vs White participants, 16.7 [2.8] years) and more frequently were women (226 [70.0\%] Black participants vs 1364 [58.5\%] White participants), were unmarried (184 [56.9\%] Black participants vs 1364 [26.7\%] White participants), and had nonspousal study partners (237 [73.4\%] Black participants vs 2147 [42.0\%] White participants). They were more frequently excluded for failure to meet cognitive inclusion criteria (eg, screen failures by specific inclusion criteria: 147 [45.5\%] Black participants vs 1338 [26.2\%] White participants). Compared with White participants, Black (odds ratio [OR], 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.34-0.54; P {$<$} .001), Hispanic (OR, 0.53; 95\% CI, 0.41-0.69; P {$<$} .001), and Asian participants (OR, 0.56; 95\% CI, 0.38-0.82; P = .003) were less likely to be eligible after screening visit 1. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Racial/ethnic groups differed in sources of recruitment, reasons for screen failure, and overall probability of eligibility in a preclinical AD trial.

  abstract = {Studies reporting an inverse association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cancer are scant. Available data are mostly based on ancillary findings of mortality data or obtained from studies evaluating frequency of neoplasms in AD patients independently if they occurred before or after AD. Moreover, some studies estimated frequencies of neoplasms in demented individuals, who were not necessarily AD patients. We estimated frequency of tumors preceding the onset of AD in AD patients and compared it to that of age- and gender-matched AD-free individuals. Occurrence of tumors preceding AD onset was assessed through a semi-structured questionnaire. Tumors were categorized as benign, malignant, or of uncertain classification and as endocrine-related or not. Odds ratios (OR), used as measure of the association between the two diseases, were adjusted for tumor categories and known risk factors for AD and tumors. We included 126 AD patients and 252 matched controls. Tumor frequency before AD onset was 18.2\% among cases and 24.2\% among controls. There was a suggestive trend of an overall inverse association between the two diseases (adjusted OR 0.6; 95\% CI 0.4\textendash 1.1; p = 0.11). Risk for neoplasms was significantly reduced only for women (adjusted OR, 0.5; 95\% CI 0.3\textendash 0.9; p = 0.03) and for endocrine related tumors (adjusted OR, 0.5; 95\% CI 0.2\textendash 1; p = 0.04). Our study confirms the inverse association reported in previous epidemiological studies. Though our findings might be explained by processes playing an opposite role in tumors development and neurodegeneration, they are also suggestive for a possible role of estrogen.},

  abstract = {Background: Previous studies have demonstrated a strong inverse association between cancer and risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to further investigate this association by examining measures of cognitive performance and neuroimaging. Methods: Neuropsychological (NP) test batteries consisting of quantitative measures of memory and executive function and volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans measuring brain and white-matter hyperintensity volumes were administered to 2,043 dementia-free participants (54\% women) in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring cohort from 1999\textendash 2005. History of cancer was assessed at examination visits and through hospital records. Linear regression was used to examine the association between cancer history and NP/MRI variables. Results: There were 252 and 1,791 participants with and without a previous history of cancer, respectively. Cancer survivors had an average time between diagnosis and NP/MRI exam of 9.8 years. History of any invasive cancer was associated with better executive function (Beta=0.16, p=0.04) but not memory function. Non-invasive cancer was not associated with any change in cognitive performance. Patients with prostate cancer had larger frontal brain volumes (Beta=4.13, p=0.03). Cancer history was not associated with any other MRI measure. Conclusions: We did not find any strong evidence linking cancer to cognitive or neuroimaging biomarkers that would explain a lower risk of subsequent AD, although a previous FHS study demonstrated a strong inverse association between cancer and risk of AD. Future work should examine the association between cancer and other biomarkers of AD as well as more sensitive metrics of AD-related brain aging markers.},

  abstract = {In observational cohort mortality studies with prolonged periods of exposure to the agent under study, it is not uncommon for risk factors for death to be determinants of subsequent exposure. For instance, in occupational mortality studies date of termination of employment is both a determinant of future exposure (since terminated individuals receive no further exposure) and an independent risk factor for death (since disabled individuals tend to leave empioyment). When current risk factor status determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure, standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative exposure may underestimate the true effect of exposure on mortality whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This observation raises the question, which if any population parameters can be given a causal interpretation in observational mortality studies? In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the identification and computation of causal parameters in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. This approach is shown to be equivalent to an approach in which the observational study is identified with a hypothetical double-blind randomized trial in which data on each subject's assigned treatment protocol has been erased from the data tile. Causal inferences can then be made by comparing mortality as a function of treatment protocol, since, in a double-blind randomized trial missing data on treatment protocol, the association of mortality with treatment protocol can still be estimated.},

In this paper, we present evidence that bactrim therapy improves survival but that the standard intent-to-treat comparison failed to detect this survival advantage because a large fraction of the subjects either crossed over to the other therapy or stopped therapy altogether. We obtain our evidence of a beneficial bactrim effect on survival by artificially regarding the subjects as dependently censored at the first time the subject either stops or switches therapy; we then analyze the data with the inverse probability of censoring weighted Kaplan-Meier and Cox partial likelihood estimators of Robins (1993, Proceedings of the Biopharmaceutical Section, American Statistical Association, pp. 24-33) that adjust for dependent censoring by utilizing data collected on time-dependent prognostic factors.},

Conclusions: In white older adults, prevalent Alzheimer disease (AD) was longitudinally associated with a reduced risk of cancer, and a history of cancer was associated with a reduced risk of AD. Together with other work showing associations between cancer and Parkinson disease, these findings suggest the possibility that cancer is linked to neurodegeneration.

This may explain counterintuitive results, where exposures that are known to be harmful for mortality risk sometimes seem protective for the risk of dementia. Authors have attempted to explain these counterintuitive results as biased, but the bias associated with a particular analytic method cannot be defined or assessed if the causal question is not explicitly specified. Indeed, we can consider several causal questions when competing events like death, which cannot be prevented by design, are present. Current dementia research guidelines have not explicitly considered what constitutes a meaningful causal question in this setting or, more generally, how this choice justifies and should drive particular analytic decisions. To contextualize current practices, we first perform a systematic review of the conduct and interpretation of longitudinal studies focused on dementia outcomes where death is a competing event. We then describe and demonstrate how to address different causal questions (referred here as ``the total effect'' and ``the controlled direct effect'') with traditional analytic approaches under explicit assumptions. Our application focuses on smoking cessation in late-midlife. To illustrate core concepts, we discuss this example both in terms of a hypothetical randomized trial and with an emulation of such a trial using observational data from the Rotterdam Study.},

  abstract = {We aimed to study the effects of hypothetical interventions on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and smoking on risk of stroke and dementia using data from 15 years of follow-up in the Rotterdam Study. We used data from 4930 individuals, aged 55\textendash 80 years, with no prior history of stroke, dementia or cognitive impairment, followed for 15 years within the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort. We defined the following sustained interventions on SBP: (1) maintaining SBP below 120 mmHg, (2) maintaining SBP below 140 mmHg, (3) reducing SBP by 10\% if above 140 mmHg, (4) reducing SBP by 20\% if above 140 mmHg, and a combined intervention of quitting smoking with each of these SBP-lowering strategies. We considered incident stroke and incident dementia diagnoses as outcomes. We applied the parametric g-formula to adjust for baseline and time-varying confounding. The observed 15-year risk for stroke was 10.7\%. Compared to no specified intervention (i.e., the ``natural course''), all interventions that involved reducing SBP were associated with a stroke risk reduction of about 10\% (e.g., reducing SBP by 20\% if above 140 mmHg risk ratio: 0.89; 95\% CI 0.76, 1). Jointly intervening on SBP and smoking status further decreased the risk of stroke (e.g., risk ratio: 0.83; 95\% CI 0.71, 0.94). None of the specified interventions were associated with a substantive change in dementia risk. Our study suggests that a joint intervention on SBP and smoking cessation during later life may reduce stroke risk, while the potential for reducing dementia risk were not observed.},

Because vascular disease is associated with cognitive impairment and dementia, we hypothesised that alcohol consumption might also affect the risk of dementia. Methods We examined the relation between alcohol consumption and risk of dementia in individuals taking part in the Rotterdam Study\textemdash a prospective population-based study of 7983 individuals aged 55 years and older. We studied all participants who did not have dementia at baseline (1990\textendash 93) and who had complete data on alcohol consumption (n=5395). Through follow-up examinations in 1993\textendash 94 and 1997\textendash 99 and an extensive monitoring system, we obtained nearly complete follow-up (99{$\cdot$}7\%) until the end of 1999. We used proportional hazards regression analysis, adjusted for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, education, smoking, and body-mass index, to compare the risk of developing dementia between individuals who regularly consumed alcohol and individuals who did not consume alcohol. Findings The average follow-up was 6{$\cdot$}0 years. During this period, 197 individuals developed dementia (146 Alzheimer's disease, 29 vascular dementia, 22 other dementia). The median alcohol consumption was 0{$\cdot$}29 drinks per day. Light-to-moderate drinking (one to three drinks per day) was significantly associated with a lower risk of any dementia (hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}58 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}38\textendash 0{$\cdot$}90]) and vascular dementia (hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}29 [0{$\cdot$}09\textendash 0{$\cdot$}93]). We found no evidence that the relation between alcohol and dementia varied by type of alcoholic beverage. Interpretation These findings suggest that light-to-moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a reduced risk of dementia in individuals aged 55 years or older. The effect seems to be unchanged by the source of alcohol.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To assess the role of selective survival in explaining reported sex/gender differences in dementia incidence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This decision analytical model used a simulated cohort of US participants aged 50 years and without dementia at baseline followed up for incident dementia through age 95 years. Selective survival was induced by a selection characteristic (eg, childhood social disadvantage or Alzheimer genetic risk) that influenced both mortality and dementia incidence at varying magnitudes. Data analysis was performed from April 2018 to May 2020. EXPOSURE Sex/gender, conceptualized as the combination of biological sex and social consequences of gender. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Dementia incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for women compared with men. In all simulations, it was assumed that there would be no true effect of sex/gender on dementia incidence; all observed sex/gender differences were due to selective survival. RESULTS At baseline, the simulation included 100 000 participants aged 50 years (51 000 [51\%] women, mirroring the 1919-1921 US birth cohort of non-Latino White individuals at age 50 years); distributions of the selection characteristic were standard normal (mean [SD], 0.0 [1.0]). Observed sex/gender differences in dementia incidence in individuals aged 85 years or older ranged from insignificant (IRR, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.91-1.11) to consistent with sex/gender differences (20\% higher risk for women [IRR, 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.32]) reported in an extant study. Simulations in which bias was large enough to explain prior findings required moderate to large differential effects of selective survival (eg, hazard ratio for selection characteristic on mortality at least 2.0 among men, no effect among women). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest that selective survival may contribute to observed sex/gender differences in dementia incidence but do not preclude potential contributions of sex/gender-specific mechanisms. Further research on plausibility of selection characteristics with outcomes of the magnitude required for selective survival to explain sex/gender differences in dementia incidence and sex/gender-specific mechanisms represent an opportunity to understand prevention and treatment of dementia.},

We validated our design by comparing our results for vascular outcomes with the effects established in large randomized trials. The study was based on the United Kingdom Health Improvement Network database that includes the computerized medical records of over four and a half million patients. RESULTS People who initiated treatment with a statin (n = 129 288) were compared with a matched sample of 600 241 people who did not initiate treatment, with a median follow-up period of 4.4 years. Statin use was not associated with an effect on a wide range of outcomes, including infections, fractures, venous thromboembolism, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, or on specific eye, neurological or autoimmune diseases. A protective effect against dementia was observed (hazard ratio 0.80, 99\% confidence interval 0.68, 0.95). There was no effect on the risk of cancer even after Ն8 years of follow-up. The effect sizes for statins on vascular end-points and mortality were comparable to those observed in large randomized trials, suggesting bias and confounding had been well controlled for. CONCLUSIONS We found little evidence to support wide-ranging effects of statins on health outcomes beyond their established beneficial effect on vascular disease.},

Individuals enrolling in the randomized controlled trial testing two anti-inflammatory agents for primary prevention of AD (Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial; ADAPT) were allowed the elective use of statins. Our objective was to assess whether statin use is associated with reduced risk of incident AD among ADAPT participants. In primary ADAPT study , participants were assessed annually for cholesterol levels and cognitive status. If impairment in cognition was noted, a dementia evaluation was performed. Onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD was taken as the date of this evaluation. Time-to-onset was analyzed in six-month intervals following enrollment. Without knowledge of primary treatment assignment in ADAPT, participants were grouped by their self-reported use of lipid-lowering agents (LLA). In the current ancillary ADAPT study we found that elective statin use was associated with significantly reduced risk of incident AD after adjustment for age, gender, education and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype. The findings were similar when comparing all LLA use (statin and non-statin LLA) to non-LLA use. Cholesterol levels were lower among statin users compared with non-LLA users, but the MMSE scores were equivalent. The data suggest that statin therapy may be of benefit in reducing the risk of AD.},

Measurements The Moray House Test (MHT) of intelligence administered at age 11 and age 80 years. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score, history of disease and current prescribed medications age 80 years. Results After adjusting for sex, neuroactive drugs had a detrimental effect on life long cognitive change age (F {$\frac{1}{4}$} 12.2, p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.001, partial eta-squared {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.026), statins a beneficial effect (F {$\frac{1}{4}$} 5.78, p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.017, partial eta-squared {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.013) and polypharmacy a detrimental effect (F {$\frac{1}{4}$} 6.46, p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.011, partial eta-squared {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.014).

Conclusions Clinically, the degree to which drugs impair cognition in relatively fit, older people may not be apparent. However, in population terms, medication use, particularly polypharmacy, is important. Statins, used as currently indicated for cardiovascular disease, appear promising in ameliorating cognitive decline in older people. However, firm recommendation of their use should await the outcome of ongoing randomised clinical trials. Copyright \# 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

PARTICIPANTS: Research volunteers with normal cognition at baseline evaluated an average 4.1 times over 3.4 years (1,244 statin users, 2,363 nonusers) and with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline evaluated an average 3.9 times over 2.8 years (763 users, 917 nonusers). MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive performance was assessed according to 10 neuropsychological indices and the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB). Repeated-measures analyses adjusted for age, sex, education, comorbidities, and family history of dementia were conducted. RESULTS: Of participants with normal cognition at baseline, statin users performed significantly better across all visits in attention (Trails A) and had significantly slower annual worsening in CDR-SOB scores (P = .006) and slower worsening in Mini-Mental State Examination scores than nonusers (which was not significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons, P = .05).

Here we propose the new separable effects to study the causal effect of a treatment on an event of interest. The separable direct effect is the treatment effect on the event of interest not mediated by its effect on the competing event. The separable indirect effect is the treatment effect on the event of interest only through its effect on the competing event. Similar to Robins and Richardson's extended graphical approach for mediation analysis, the separable effects can only be identified under the assumption that the treatment can be decomposed into two distinct components that exert their effects through distinct causal pathways. Unlike existing definitions of causal effects in the presence of competing events, our estimands do not require cross-world contrasts or hypothetical interventions to prevent death. As an illustration, we apply our approach to a randomized clinical trial on estrogen therapy in individuals with prostate cancer. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

However, effects of treatment on the competing event may indirectly contribute to this total effect, complicating its interpretation. We previously proposed the               separable effects               to define direct and indirect effects of the treatment on the event of interest. This definition was given in a simple setting, where the treatment was decomposed into two components acting along two separate causal pathways. Here we generalize the notion of separable effects, allowing for interpretation, identification and estimation in a wide variety of settings. We propose and discuss a definition of separable effects that is applicable to general time-varying structures, where the separable effects can still be meaningfully interpreted as effects of modified treatments, even when they cannot be regarded as direct and indirect effects. For these settings we derive weaker conditions for identification of separable effects in studies where decomposed, or otherwise modified, treatments are not yet available; in particular, these conditions allow for time-varying common causes of the event of interest, the competing events and loss to follow-up. We also propose semi-parametric weighted estimators that are straightforward to implement. We stress that unlike previous definitions of direct and indirect effects, the separable effects can be subject to empirical scrutiny in future studies.},

However, the impact of survival bias, as well as the confounding by medical treatment, have not been fully addressed. We aimed to explore the subsequent risk of dementia in different follow-up intervals among patients with cancer, as well as the risk before the diagnosis of cancer. Methods: By using the Swedish Cancer Register and the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register, we systematically examined the risk of dementia among patients diagnosed with 35 different types of cancer. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to calculate the relative risk. Results: The subsequent risk of dementia in patients with cancer decreased by 21\% compared to matched cancer-free controls (SIR = 0.79, 95\% CI 0.78\textendash 0.80). For specific cancer sites, 21 of them had a significantly lower risk of subsequent dementia. The decreased risk of dementia was also significant before the diagnosis of cancer. However, the risk was higher among patients with cancer who survived for more than 10 years' post-diagnosis (SIR = 1.37, 95\% CI 1.32\textendash 1.41). Conclusions: In this population-based study, we found that the risk of dementia was lower among patients with cancer, and the risk was also lower before the diagnosis of cancer. This suggests that lower dementia risk is not simply due to bias. However, the underlying mechanisms need to be explored further.},

  abstract = {Purpose The decision whether to continue antidepressant use for depression during pregnancy requires weighing maternal and child risks and benefits. Little is known about the effectiveness of antidepressant therapy during pregnancy. The goal of this study is to evaluate whether standard administrative claims data can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of antidepressants. Methods Using prescription and healthcare visit Medicaid claims (2000\textendash 2007), we identified 28 493 women with a depression diagnosis and antidepressant fill in the 90 days before their last menstrual period. Antidepressant continuation was defined based on prescription fills during the first trimester. Depression hospitalizations and deliberate self-harm served as measures of the effectiveness of treatment continuation during pregnancy. Propensity score and instrumental variable analyses were used to attempt to account for confounding. Results Relative to women who discontinued antidepressant therapy, women who continued were more likely to have a depression inpatient stay (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2, 95\% confidence interval [95\%CI]: 2.0\textendash 2.4) and deliberate self-harm code (OR = 1.4, 95\%CI: 0.7\textendash 2.7). Accounting for measured covariates in the propensity score analysis, including age, race, comorbidities, comedications, features of the depression diagnosis, and antidepressant class, led to slightly attenuated estimates (OR = 2.0, 95\%CI: 1.8\textendash 2.2; OR = 1.1, 95\%CI: 0.5\textendash 2.4). Similar associations were estimated in subgroups with different levels of baseline depression severity. Proposed preference-time, calendar-time-based, and geography-based instruments were unlikely to meet the required conditions for a valid analysis. Conclusions Our findings suggest that either antidepressant medications do not reduce the risk of depression relapse in pregnant women, or that administrative data alone could not be used to validly estimate the effectiveness of psychotropic medications during pregnancy.

  abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) studies are often described as naturally occurring randomized trials in which genetic factors are randomly assigned by nature. Conceptualizing MR studies as randomized trials has profound implications for their design, conduct, reporting, and interpretation. For example, analytic practices that are discouraged in randomized trials should also be discouraged in MR studies. Here, we deconstruct the oft-made analogy between MR and randomized trials. We describe four key threats to the analogy between MR studies and randomized trials: (1) exchangeability is not guaranteed; (2) time zero (and therefore the time for setting eligibility criteria) is unclear; (3) the treatment assignment is often measured with error; and (4) adherence is poorly defined. By precisely defining the causal effects being estimated, we underscore that MR estimates are often vaguely analogous to perprotocol effects in randomized trials, and that current MR methods for estimating analogues of per-protocol effects could be biased in practice. We conclude that the analogy between randomized trials and MR studies provides further perspective on both the strengths and the limitations of MR studies as currently implemented, as well as future directions for MR methodology development and application. In particular, the analogy highlights potential future directions for some MR studies to produce more interpretable and informative numerical estimates.},

  abstract = {Background: Previously reported associations between statin use and incident dementia or cognitive decline have been inconsistent. We report the results from a 3-year prospective study on the association of statin use on cognitive decline and incident dementia in elderly African Americans. Methods: A community-based cohort of 1,146 African Americans aged 70 and older living in Indianapolis, Indiana, was evaluated in 2001 and 2004. The instrument used for cognitive assessment was the Community Screening Interview for Dementia (CSI-D). Cognitive decline was defined as CSI-D scores measured at 2001 minus scores at 2004. Measurements of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were obtained from baseline blood samples. Results: Adjusting for age at baseline, gender, education, and the possession of ApoE ␧4 allele, baseline statin use was associated with less cognitive decline (p ϭ 0.0177). There were no significant interactions of statin use when LDL-C and CRP were included. Logistic regression with the four independent variables showed that statin use may be associated with a reduction in incident dementia (OR ϭ 0.32; p ϭ 0.0673). Association with cognitive decline was less clear when investigating statin use over time. Significance remained only for those who discontinued prior to follow-up compared to continuous users or users who started after baseline. Conclusions: The relationship between statin use and cognitive decline is complex and subjected to unknown confounders. This effect may not be associated with the cholesterol lowering or antiinflammatory action of statins. Neurology\textregistered{} 2007;69:1873\textendash 1880},

  abstract = {For an experimental animal exposed to k {$>$} 1 possible risks of death R1, R2, -*, Rk, the term i-th potential survival time designates a random variable Yi supposed to represent the age at death of the animal in hypothetical conditions in which Ri is the only possible risk. The probability that Yi will exceed a preassigned t is called the i-th net survival probability. The results of a survival experiment are represented by kI "crude" survival functions, empirical counterparts of the probabilities Qi(t) that an animal will survive at least up to the age t and eventually die from Ri. The analysis of a survival experiment aims at estimating the k net survival probabilities using the empirical data on those termed crude. Theorems 1 and 2 establish the relationship between the net and the crude probabilities of survival. In particular, Theorem 2 shows that, without the not directly verifiable assumption that in their joint distribution the variables Y1, Y2, **, kare mutually independent, a given set of crude survival probabilities Qi(t) does not identify the corresponding net probabilities. An example shows that the results of a customary method of analysis, based on the assumption that Yi, Y2, ., Ykare independent, may have no resemblance to reality.},

  abstract = {Causal inference based on a restricted version of the potential outcomes approach reasoning is assuming an increasingly prominent place in the teaching and practice of epidemiology. The proposed concepts and methods are useful for particular problems, but it would be of concern if the theory and practice of the complete field of epidemiology were to become restricted to this single approach to causal inference. Our concerns are that this theory restricts the questions that epidemiologists may ask and the study designs that they may consider. It also restricts the evidence that may be considered acceptable to assess causality, and thereby the evidence that may be considered acceptable for scientific and public health decision making. These restrictions are based on a particular conceptual framework for thinking about causality. In Section 1, we describe the characteristics of the restricted potential outcomes approach (RPOA) and show that there is a methodological movement which advocates these principles, not just for solving particular problems, but as ideals for which epidemiology as a whole should strive. In Section 2, we seek to show that the limitation of epidemiology to one particular view of the nature of causality is problematic. In Section 3, we argue that the RPOA is also problematic with regard to the assessment of causality. We argue that it threatens to restrict study design choice, to wrongly discredit the results of types of observational studies that have been very useful in the past and to damage the teaching of epidemiological reasoning. Finally, in Section 4 we set out what we regard as a more reasonable `working hypothesis' as to the nature of causality and its assessment: pragmatic pluralism.},

When adjustment is made for socioeconomic status early in a person's life, we discuss under what contexts the regression coefficients for race can be interpreted as corresponding to the extent to which a racial inequality would remain if various socioeconomic distributions early in life across racial groups could be equalized. When adjustment is also made for adult socioeconomic status, we note how the overall racial inequality can be decomposed into the portion that would be eliminated by equalizing adult socioeconomic status across racial groups and the portion of the inequality that would remain even if adult socioeconomic status across racial groups were equalized. We also discuss a stronger interpretation of the effect of race (stronger in terms of assumptions) involving the joint effects of race-associated physical phenotype (eg, skin color), parental physical phenotype, genetic background, and cultural context when such variables are thought to be hypothetically manipulable and if adequate control for confounding were possible. We discuss some of the challenges with such an interpretation. Further discussion is given as to how the use of selected populations in examining racial disparities can additionally complicate the interpretation of the effects.},

In contrast, population-based studies consistently find an inverse link between cancer and dementia, that is patients with dementia having a lower risk of subsequently developing cancer, and cancer patients being less often diagnosed with dementia. Different biological processes such as inversely activated cell proliferation and survival pathways have been suggested to have an important role underlying this inverse association. However, the effect of methodological biases including surveillance or survival bias has not been completely ruled out, calling into question the inverse direction of the association between cancer and dementia. In fact, emerging evidence now suggests that cancer and dementia might share a positive association. This narrative review summarises the current literature on cancer, cognitive problems and dementia. Moreover, different strategies will be discussed to reduce the impact of potential methodological biases on the association between cancer and dementia, trying to reveal the true direction of this link.},

Many papers have pointed out the important issue of competing events (or competing risks) in such analyses. For example, when studying one particular cause of death it can be noted that patients also die from other causes. Such competing events preclude the event of interest from occurring and thereby complicate the statistical analysis. The Kaplan\textendash Meier approach to calculating the cumulative probability of the event of interest yields invalid results in the presence of competing risks, thus the alternative cumulative incidence competing risk (CICR) approach has become the standard. However, when kidney transplant is the competing event that prevents observing the outcome of interest, CICR may not always be the matter of interest. We discuss situations where both the Kaplan\textendash Meier and the CICR approach are not suitable for the purpose and point out alternative analysis methods for such situations. We also look at the suitability and interpretation of different estimators for relative risks. In the presence of transplant as a competing risk, one should very clearly state the research question and use an analysis method that targets this question.},

We provide a formal definition of the estimands matching these questions, give examples of settings in which each is useful and discuss appropriate estimators including their assumptions. We illustrate the impact of the predictimand choice in a dataset of patients with end-stage kidney disease.

A particular methodological challenge in observational studies is to estimate the unbiased effect of a time-varying exposure in presence of time-varying confounders, if those confounders are affected by prior exposure. In such cases, the parametric g-formula can be applied to estimate an unbiased effect. We applied the parametric g-formula to estimate the 18-years (1994\textendash 2012) cumulative stroke risk under different scenarios of hypothetical interventions on levels of blood pressure, cholesterol, weight, physical activity, smoking and alcohol intake; and compared these to the observed scenario, to calculate the population risk ratios and risk differences. Among 14,796 eligible participants in the prospective, population-based Troms\o{} study (baseline mean age 46.1 years, 51\% women), the observed 18-years stroke risk was 5.9\%. A feasible joint hypothetical intervention on six lifestyle and metabolic risk factors would reduce the 18-year stroke risk by 32\% (95\% confidence interval 16, 44). A combination of more intensive interventions reduced the estimated 18-years stroke risk by 64\% (95\% confidence interval 40, 80). Blood pressure reduction and quitting smoking significantly reduced the risk when applied separately.},

Study Design and Setting: The Neurological Disorders in Central Spain study is a longitudinal, population-based survey of chronic neurologic conditions in persons aged {$>$}65 years. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine baseline differences between participants who took part in the 3-year follow-up evaluation vs. those who did not. Results: Of the 5,278 participants evaluated at baseline (1994e1995), 1,482 (28.1\%) were lost to the follow-up (1997e1998). Factors that were associated with dropout due to refusal were as follows: living in a rural area and being single. Contact failure was associated with older age and being unmarried and widowed. Unreachable participants were less likely to take three or more medications or live in a professional neighborhood. Predictors of dropout due to death were male gender, older age, having impaired activities of daily living, taking more medications, poor self-perceived health, dementia, and smoking. Conclusions: These findings on participants who are at high risk of dropout may be useful in the planning phase of future prospective studies. Of the possible reasons for attrition, refusal is the most important because it is amenable to change. \'O 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine the association of midlife to late-life BP patterns with subsequent dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and cognitive decline. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities prospective population-based cohort study enrolled 4761 participants during midlife (visit 1, 1987-1989) and followed-up over 6 visits through 2016-2017 (visit 6). BP was examined over 24 years at 5 in-person visits between visits 1 and 5 (2011-2013). During visits 5 and 6, participants underwent detailed neurocognitive evaluation. The setting was 4 US communities: Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Follow-up ended on December 31, 2017. EXPOSURES Five groups based on longitudinal patterns of normotension, hypertension ({$>$}140/90 mm Hg), and hypotension ({$<$}90/60 mm Hg) at visits 1 to 5. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was dementia onset after visit 5, based on Ascertain Dementia-8 informant questionnaires, Six-Item Screener telephone assessments, hospital discharge and death certificate codes, and the visit 6 neurocognitive evaluation. Secondary outcome was mild cognitive impairment at visit 6, based on the neurocognitive evaluation. RESULTS Among 4761 participants (2821 [59\%] women; 979 [21\%] black race; visit 5 mean [SD] age, 75 [5] years; visit 1 mean age range, 44-66 years; visit 5 mean age range, 66-90 years), there were 516 (11\%) incident dementia cases between visits 5 and 6. The dementia incidence rate for participants with normotension in midlife (n = 833) and late life was 1.31 (95\% CI, 1.00-1.72 per 100 person-years); for midlife normotension and late-life hypertension (n = 1559), 1.99 (95\% CI, 1.69-2.32 per 100 person-years); for midlife and late-life hypertension (n = 1030), 2.83 (95\% CI, 2.40-3.35 per 100 person-years); for midlife normotension and late-life hypotension (n = 927), 2.07 (95\% CI, 1.68-2.54 per 100 person-years); and for midlife hypertension and late-life hypotension (n = 389), 4.26 (95\% CI, 3.40-5.32 per 100 person-years). Participants in the midlife and late-life hypertension group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.49 [95\% CI, 1.06-2.08]) and in the midlife hypertension and late-life hypotension group (HR, 1.62 [95\% CI, 1.11-2.37]) had significantly increased risk of subsequent dementia compared with those who remained normotensive. Irrespective of late-life BP, sustained hypertension in midlife was associated with dementia risk (HR, 1.41 [95\% CI, 1.17-1.71]). Compared with those who were normotensive in midlife and late life, only participants with midlife hypertension and late-life hypotension had higher risk of mild cognitive impairment (37 affected individuals (odds ratio, 1.65 [95\% CI, 1.01-2.69]). There was no significant association of BP patterns with late-life cognitive change. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this community-based cohort with long-term follow-up, sustained hypertension in midlife to late life and a pattern of midlife hypertension and late-life hypotension, compared with midlife and late-life normal BP, were associated with increased risk for subsequent dementia.},

  abstract = {Background: US-based studies have reported that older blacks perform worse than older whites on cognitive tests and have higher risk of Alzheimer disease dementia (AD). It is unclear whether these findings reflect differences in cognitive decline. Methods: The Chicago Health and Aging Project followed individuals, 65+ years old (64\% black, 36\% white), for up to 18 years. Participants underwent triennial cognitive assessments; stratified randomized samples underwent assessments for AD. We compared black and white participants' cognitive performance, cognitive decline rate (N = 7,735), and AD incidence (N = 2,144), adjusting for age and sex. Results: Black participants performed worse than white participants on the cognitive tests; 441 participants developed AD. Black participants' incident AD risk was twice that of whites (RR = 1.9; 95\% CI, 1.4, 2.7), with 58 excess cases/1,000 occurring among blacks (95\% CI, 28, 88). Among noncarriers of APOE {$\epsilon$}4, blacks had 2.3 times the AD risk (95\% CI, 1.5, 3.6), but among carriers, race was not associated with risk (RR = 1.1; 95\% CI, 0.6, 2.0; Pinteraction = 0.05). However, cognitive decline was not faster among blacks: the blackwhite difference in 5-year change in global cognitive score was 0.007 standard unit (95\% CI, -0.034, 0.047). Years of education accounted for a sizable portion of racial disparities in cognitive level and AD risk, in analyses using a counterfactual approach. Conclusions: The higher risk of AD among blacks may stem from lower level of cognitive test performance persisting throughout},

  abstract = {Objective: To explore the association of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and Alzheimer disease (AD) in the Einstein Aging Study, an epidemiologic study of aging in New York City. Methods: Community-residing volunteers aged 70 years or older were assessed annually, followed by multidisciplinary diagnostic consensus. Cancer status and type was obtained by self-report. Cox proportional hazards models were used to test associations between NMSC and subsequent risk of developing a neurocognitive disorder. To deduce a biologically specific association between AD and NMSC, we considered 3 nested outcomes groups: only AD (probable or possible AD as the sole diagnosis), any AD (probable AD or possible AD, as well as mixed AD/ vascular dementia), and all-cause dementia. Results: We followed 1,102 adults with a mean age of 79 years at enrollment. Prevalent NMSC was associated with reduced risk of only AD (hazard ratio 5 0.21; 95\% confidence interval 5 0.051\textendash 0.87; p 5 0.031) among subjects after adjustment for demographics, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease. APOE e4 genotypes were available in 769 individuals. The association was similar in magnitude, but nonsignificant, when the number of APOE e4 alleles was included in the model. No significant association was found between NMSC and subsequent development of any AD or all-cause dementia. Conclusions: This population-based longitudinal study shows that individuals older than 70 years with NMSC have a significantly reduced risk of developing AD compared with individuals without NMSC. We deduce Alzheimer-specific neuroprotection, because the effect is attenuated or eliminated when considering less-specific diagnoses such as AD with another diagnosis (any AD) or all-cause dementia.

  abstract = {Censored data make survival analysis more complicated because exact event times are not observed. Statistical methodology developed to account for censored observations assumes that patients' withdrawal from a study is independent of the event of interest. However, in practice, some covariates might be associated to both lifetime and censoring mechanism, inducing dependent censoring. In this case, standard survival techniques, like Kaplan\textendash Meier estimator, give biased results. The inverse probability censoring weighted estimator was developed to correct for bias due to dependent censoring. In this article, we explore the use of inverse probability censoring weighting methodology and describe why it is effective in removing the bias. Since implementing this method is highly time consuming and requires programming and mathematical skills, we propose a user friendly algorithm in R. Applications to a toy example and to a medical data set illustrate how the algorithm works. A simulation study was carried out to investigate the performance of the inverse probability censoring weighted estimators in situations where dependent censoring is present in the data. In the simulation process, different sample sizes, strengths of the censoring model, and percentages of censored individuals were chosen. Results show that in each scenario inverse probability censoring weighting reduces the bias induced in the traditional Kaplan\textendash Meier approach where dependent censoring is ignored.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of intensive blood pressure control on risk of dementia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial conducted at 102 sites in the United States and Puerto Rico among adults aged 50 years or older with hypertension but without diabetes or history of stroke. Randomization began on November 8, 2010. The trial was stopped early for benefit on its primary outcome (a composite of cardiovascular events) and all-cause mortality on August 20, 2015. The final date for follow-up of cognitive outcomes was July 22, 2018. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to a systolic blood pressure goal of either less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment group; n = 4678) or less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment group; n = 4683). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary cognitive outcome was occurrence of adjudicated probable dementia. Secondary cognitive outcomes included adjudicated mild cognitive impairment and a composite outcome of mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia. RESULTS Among 9361 randomized participants (mean age, 67.9 years; 3332 women [35.6\%]), 8563 (91.5\%) completed at least 1 follow-up cognitive assessment. The median intervention period was 3.34 years. During a total median follow-up of 5.11 years, adjudicated probable dementia occurred in 149 participants in the intensive treatment group vs 176 in the standard treatment group (7.2 vs 8.6 cases per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.67-1.04). Intensive BP control significantly reduced the risk of mild cognitive impairment (14.6 vs 18.3 cases per 1000 person-years; HR, 0.81; 95\% CI, 0.69-0.95) and the combined rate of mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia (20.2 vs 24.1 cases per 1000 person-years; HR, 0.85; 95\% CI, 0.74-0.97). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among ambulatory adults with hypertension, treating to a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 120 mm Hg compared with a goal of less than 140 mm Hg did not result in a significant reduction in the risk of probable dementia. Because of early study termination and fewer than expected cases of dementia, the study may have been underpowered for this end point.},

  abstract = {Background: Statins are a class of medications that reduce cholesterol by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. Whether statins can benefit patients with dementia remains unclear because of conflicting results. We hypothesized that some of the confusion in the literature might arise from differences in efficacy of different statins. We used a large database to compare the action of several different statins to investigate whether some statins might be differentially associated with a reduction in the incidence of dementia and Parkinson's disease. Methods: We analyzed data from the decision support system of the US Veterans Affairs database, which contains diagnostic, medication and demographic information on 4.5 million subjects. The association of lovastatin, simvastatin and atorvastatin with dementia was examined with Cox proportional hazard models for subjects taking statins compared with subjects taking cardiovascular medications other than statins, after adjusting for covariates associated with dementia or Parkinson's disease. Results: We observed that simvastatin is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of dementia in subjects {$\geq$}65 years, using any of three models. The first model incorporated adjustment for age, the second model included adjusted for three known risk factors for dementia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease or diabetes, and the third model incorporated adjustment for the Charlson index, which is an index that provides a broad assessment of chronic disease. Data were obtained for over 700000 subjects taking simvastatin and over 50000 subjects taking atorvastatin who were aged {$>$}64 years. Using model 3, the hazard ratio for incident dementia for simvastatin and atorvastatin are 0.46 (CI 0.44\textendash 0.48, p {$<$} 0.0001) and 0.91 (CI 0.80\textendash 1.02, p = 0.11), respectively. Lovastatin was not associated with a reduction in the incidence of dementia. Simvastatin also exhibited a reduced hazard ratio for newly acquired Parkinson's disease (HR 0.51, CI 0.4\textendash 0.55, p {$<$} 0.0001). Conclusion: Simvastatin is associated with a strong reduction in the incidence of dementia and Parkinson's disease, whereas atorvastatin is associated with a modest reduction in incident dementia and Parkinson's disease, which shows only a trend towards significance.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Inverse probability of treatment weighted Kaplan-Meier estimates have been developed to compare two treatments in the presence of confounders in observational studies. Recently, stabilized weights were developed to reduce the influence of extreme inverse probability of treatment-weighted weights in estimating treatment effects. The objective of this research was to use adjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates and modified log-rank and Wilcoxon tests to examine the effect of a treatment that varies over time in an observational study. Methods: We proposed stabilized weight adjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates and modified log-rank and Wilcoxon tests when the treatment was time-varying over the follow-up period. We applied these new methods in examining the effect of an anti-platelet agent, clopidogrel, on subsequent events, including bleeding, myocardial infarction, and death after a drug-eluting stent was implanted into a coronary artery. In this population, clopidogrel use may change over time based on a patient's behavior (e.g., nonadherence) and physicians' recommendations (e.g., end of duration of therapy). Consequently, clopidogrel use was treated as a time-varying variable. Results: We demonstrate that 1) the sample sizes at three chosen time points are almost identical in the original and weighted datasets; and 2) the covariates between patients on and off clopidogrel were well balanced after stabilized weights were applied to the original samples. Conclusions: The stabilized weight-adjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates and modified log-rank and Wilcoxon tests are useful in presenting and comparing survival functions for time-varying treatments in observational studies while adjusting for known confounders.},

Surprisingly, however, epidemiologic data from several recent independent cohort studies suggest that there may be an inverse association between these diseases. Objective: To determine the relationship between history of cancer and odds of dementia proximate to death and neuropathological indices of AD. Methods: Using data from two separate clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging and AD, the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), we compared odds of AD dementia proximate to death among participants with and without a history of cancer. We then examined the relation of history of cancer with measures of AD pathology at autopsy, i.e., paired helical filament tau (PHFtau) neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid-NL load. Results: Participants reporting a history of cancer had significantly lower odds of AD (OR 0.70 [0.55\textendash 0.89], p = 0.0040) proximate to death as compared to participants reporting no prior history of cancer. The results remained significant after adjusting for multiple risk factors including age, sex, race, education, and presence of an APOE ␧4 allele. At autopsy, participants with a history of cancer had significantly fewer PHFtau tangles (p {$<$} 0.001) than participants without a history of cancer, but similar levels of amyloid-NL. Conclusions: Cancer survivors have reduced odds of developing AD and a lower burden of neurofibrillary tangle deposition.},

  abstract = {Ideally, randomized trials would be used to compare the long-term effectiveness of dynamic treatment regimes on clinically relevant outcomes. However, because randomized trials are not always feasible or timely, we often must rely on observational data to compare dynamic treatment regimes. An example of a dynamic treatment regime is ``start combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) within 6 months of CD4 cell count first dropping below x cells/mm3 or diagnosis of an AIDS-defining illness, whichever happens first'' where x can take values between 200 and 500. Recently, Cain et al. (Ann. Intern. Med. 154(8):509\textendash 515, 2011) used inverse probability (IP) weighting of dynamic marginal structural models to find the x that minimizes 5-year mortality risk under similar dynamic regimes using observational data. Unlike standard methods, IP weighting can appropriately adjust for measured time-varying confounders (e.g., CD4 cell count, viral load) that are affected by prior treatment. Here we describe an alternative method to IP weighting for comparing the effectiveness of dynamic cART regimes: the parametric g-formula. The parametric g-formula naturally handles dynamic regimes and, like IP weighting, can appropriately adjust for measured time-varying confounders. However, estimators based on the parametric g-formula are more efficient than IP weighted estimators. This is often at the expense of more parametric assumptions. Here we describe how to use the parametric g-formula to estimate risk by the end of a user-specified follow-up period under dynamic treatment regimes. We describe an application of this method to answer the ``when to start'' question using data from the HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration.},

  abstract = {Background: Randomized trials are considered the gold standard for making inferences about the causal effects of treatments. However, when protocol deviations occur, the baseline randomization of the trial is no longer sufficient to ensure unbiased estimation of the per-protocol effect: post-randomization, time-varying confounders must be sufficiently measured and adjusted for in the analysis. Given the historical emphasis on intention-to-treat effects in randomized trials, measurement of post-randomization confounders is typically infrequent. This may induce bias in estimates of the per-protocol effect, even using methods such as inverse probability weighting, which appropriately account for time-varying confounders affected by past treatment. Methods/design: In order to concretely illustrate the potential magnitude of bias due to infrequent measurement of time-varying covariates, we simulated data from a very large trial with a survival outcome and time-varying confounding affected by past treatment. We generated the data such that the true underlying per-protocol effect is null and under varying degrees of confounding (strong, moderate, weak). In the simulated data, we estimated per-protocol survival curves and associated contrasts using inverse probability weighting under monthly measurement of the time-varying covariates (which constituted complete measurement in our simulation), yearly measurement, as well as 3- and 6-month intervals. Results: Using inverse probability weighting, we were able to recover the true null under the complete measurement scenario no matter the strength of confounding. Under yearly measurement intervals, the estimate of the per-protocol effect diverged from the null; inverse probability weighted estimates of the per-protocol 5-year risk ratio based on yearly measurement were 1.19, 1.12, and 1.03 under strong, moderate, and weak confounding, respectively. Bias decreased with measurement interval length. Under all scenarios, inverse probability weighted estimators were considerably less biased than a naive estimator that ignored time-varying confounding completely. Conclusions: Bias that arises from interval measurement designs highlights the need for planning in the design of randomized trials for collection of time-varying covariate data. This may come from more frequent in-person measurement or external sources (e.g., electronic medical record data). Such planning will provide improved estimates of the per-protocol effect through the use of methods that appropriately adjust for time-varying confounders.},

  abstract = {Objective To compare the effectiveness of dynamic anemia management strategies by applying the parametric g-formula to electronic health records. Data Source/Study Setting Patients with end-stage renal disease from the US Renal Data System who had congestive heart failure or ischemic heart disease and were undergoing hemodialysis in outpatient dialysis facilities between 2006 and 2010. Study Design We explicitly emulated a target trial of three ?erythropoietin dosing strategies (aimed at achieving a low, middle, or high hematocrit) and estimated the observational analog of the per-protocol effect. Results Of 156,945 eligible patients, 41,970 died during the 18-month follow-up. Compared to the low-hematocrit strategy, the estimated risk of death was 4.6 (95\% CI 4.4?4.9) percentage points higher under the high-hematocrit strategy and 1.8 (95\% CI 1.7?1.9) percentage points higher under the mid-hematocrit strategy. The corresponding risk differences for a composite outcome of death and myocardial infarction were similar. Conclusion An explicit emulation of a target trial using electronic health records, combined with the parametric g-formula, allowed comparison of real-world dynamic strategies that have not been compared in randomized trials.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The neurocognitive effect of statins in older adults remain uncertain. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of statin use with cognitive decline and incident dementia among older adults. METHODS This analysis included 18,846 participants \$65 years of age in a randomized trial of aspirin, who had no prior cardiovascular events, major physical disability, or dementia initially and were followed for 4.7 years. Outcome measures included incident dementia and its subclassifications (probable Alzheimer's disease, mixed presentations); mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and its subclassifications (MCI consistent with Alzheimer's disease, other MCI); and changes in domain-specific cognition, including global cognition, memory, language and executive function, psychomotor speed, and the composite of these domains. Associations of baseline statin use versus nonuse with dementia and MCI outcomes were examined using Cox proportional hazards models and with cognitive change using linear mixed-effects models, adjusting for potential confounders. The impact of statin lipophilicity on these associations was further examined, and effect modifiers were identified. RESULTS Statin use versus nonuse was not associated with dementia, MCI, or their subclassifications or with changes in cognitive function scores over time (p {$>$} 0.05 for all). No differences were found in any outcomes between hydrophilic and lipophilic statin users. Baseline neurocognitive ability was an effect modifier for the associations of statins with dementia (p for interaction {$<$} 0.001) and memory change (p for interaction {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.02). CONCLUSIONS In adults \$65 years of age, statin therapy was not associated with incident dementia, MCI, or declines in individual cognition domains. These findings await confirmation from ongoing randomized trials. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2021;77:3145\textendash 56) \textcopyright{} 2021 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},
