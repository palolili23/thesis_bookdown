1.	We can apply the target trial framework to refine the research question and prevent certain sources of bias, even if we do not have the measurement of the variable on which we would like to intervene upon. (This thesis)

2.	Observational studies in dementia research would benefit from deeper discussions on what is the ideal time-zero to measure an exposure/intervention, even if actual data was not collected at that ideal time. (This thesis)

3.	Time-varying causal directed acyclic graphs are intimidating yet more intuitive for understanding selection mechanisms than time-fixed causal directed acyclic graphs. (This thesis)

10.	It is possible to write a thesis in epidemiology without p-values.

11. something about large gap between applied research and methods development, and we need to value, interdisciplinary work and value being in the middle?
