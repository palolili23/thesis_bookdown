THIS THESIS

-   We can apply the target trial framework to refine the research question and prevent certain sources of bias, even if we do not have the measurement of the variable on which we would like to intervene upon.

-   Observational studies would benefit from deeper discussions on what is the ideal time-zero to measure an exposure/intervention, even if actual data was not collected at that ideal time.

-   Time-varying causal directed acyclic graphs (dags) may look intimidating but are much more intuitive to understand selection mechanisms than time fixed dags.

-   We always take into account the competing event.. even ignoring it implies certain assumptions and specific interpretations.

-   All competing events act as colliders, but not all colliders are competing events.

-   Clear assumptions correspond to clear interpretations. XX

-   Assumptions help us bridge the large gap between the measured data and the underlying mechanisms we want to study. XX

-   It is possible to write a thesis in epidemiology without p-values

BEYOND THIS THESIS

-   To search for all the refutable consequences of a hypothesis demands highly imaginative thinking. Imagination is needed to arrive at the hypothesis in the first place, let alone to suggest rigorous tests for it. (Carol Buck)

-   Calling for diversity and inclusion is not enough when we need full accountability on academia's colonial, patriarchal and racist roots that perpetuate a system of oppression that affects research and the populations to whom it should service.

-   My opportunities ahead are open thanks to all those moms who stay in academia breaking the glass ceiling.

-   Inequities in scholarly publication disincentive researchers in the global South from contributing to the global scientific body of knowledge. (Prof Agnes Binagwaho)
