## Abstract

In longitudinal studies of treatment/exposure effects on dementia, death is often a competing event. When death is present, there are many ways to define a causal effect on dementia (i.e. the risk difference or ratio under elimination of death vs. without elimination of death). We performed a systematic review of longitudinal studies focused (implicitly or explicitly) on causal effects on dementia risk to contextualize how death is handled. Eligibility for the systematic review included: original research with longitudinal data on dementia or Alzheimer’s disease outcomes; published between January 2018 to December 2019; published in one of nine medicine or neurology journals; and having an implicit or explicit study aim of estimating a causal effect. We summarized how death during follow-up is handled in the design, analysis, reporting, and interpretation of results. Out of 57 included studies, only 11% had a clear and complete description of how death was defined in the methods section, while 47% did not include any description at all. Fifty six percent described how many died over follow-up; 18% presented data by exposure level. Most studies (93%) presented estimates of a hazard ratio, mostly under a Cox proportional hazards model, though none reported a clear interpretation given the presence of a competing event nor discussed the assumptions related to death as a competing event. Furthermore, 86% interpreted hazard ratios as inferring something about a risk. This review suggests much room for improvement in how we define, estimate, and interpret causal effects in dementia studies with death.

## Introduction

In longitudinal studies of treatment/exposure effects on dementia, some participants may die prior to dementia onset or diagnosis. In such studies, death is an example of a competing event[@tsiatis1975; @young2020]. When death is present, there are many ways to define a causal effect on dementia (i.e. the risk difference or ratio under elimination of death vs. without elimination of death)[2]. Even for the same exposure, these effects can differ in magnitude and direction particularly when the exposure affects death. Likewise, they rely on different assumptions and statistical methods. On the contrary, hazard ratios do not have a causal interpretation in general because they are conditional on survival[@young2020; @hernan2010; @stensrud2020; @geskus2016].  We performed a systematic review of longitudinal studies focused (implicitly or explicitly) on exposure effects on dementia risk, in order to summarize how death during follow-up is handled in the design, analysis, reporting, and interpretation of results.


## Methods


Eligibility for the systematic review included: original research with a study design that corresponds to an observational study or randomized trial with longitudinal follow-up and with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease as outcome; published between January 2018 to December 2019; published in one of nine medicine or neurology journals; and having an implicit or explicit study aim of estimating a causal effect. Search criteria on PubMed included: Alzheimer’s disease or dementia; longitudinal or cohort; hazard or risks. All details are presented as Supplementary Information. We collected the following information: study characteristics (exposure of interest, target causal parameter, median length of follow-up); report on total deaths over time and across levels of the exposure of interest and total losses to follow-up; specific methodologic considerations (how death is handled in the analysis plan, primary statistical measure, primary statistical method); and interpretation (valid interpretation of the primary result in light of deaths, mentions mortality in discussion).


## Results


Fifty-seven studies ultimately met our eligibility criteria (Figure). Mean or median follow-up was over 5 years for 84% of the studies (Table). The number or proportion of individuals who died over time was reported in 56% of papers; 18% presented these numbers by exposure level. Only 11% had a clear and complete description of how death was treated in the main analysis, while 47% did not include any description on how death was handled in the methods section. The vast majority (93%) presented estimates of a hazard ratio, mostly under a Cox proportional hazards model though none reported the correct interpretation given the presence of a competing event nor discussed the assumptions related to death as a competing event[@young2020; @geskus2016; @andersen2012]. Furthermore, 86% interpreted hazard ratios as inferring something about a risk (e.g. “the exposure increased the risk of dementia, HR:X, 95%CI”) and only one study gave an explicit interpretation that matched the target causal parameter of interest. Overall, only one-third mentioned death in some context in the discussion section.

## Conclusions


This study shows that death is often not considered as part of the main analysis with clear description of the methods or assumptions for valid estimation. This is problematic because it leads to an unclear definition of the causal effect of interest and therefore unclear interpretation of results. Moreover, hazard ratios were the primary statistical measure in most studies, and were frequently interpreted as implying something about a risk, which can be a misinterpretation especially in settings with competing events[@geskus2016]. We caution researchers against the emphasis on hazards in settings like this because they can have different interpretations: e.g., the hazard of dementia under elimination of death, the hazard of dementia without elimination of death, or the hazard of dementia conditional on surviving[@young2020; @geskus2016]. Such interpretations rely on different assumptions with respect to death, and even so they generally cannot be interpreted as a causal effect[@young2020; @hernan2010; @stensrud2020; @geskus2016]. Altogether, this review suggests much room for improvement in how we define, estimate, and interpret causal effects in dementia studies with death. Minimally, we encourage researchers to consider as a standard practice reporting the number of participants who die over follow-up by treatment/exposure levels.
