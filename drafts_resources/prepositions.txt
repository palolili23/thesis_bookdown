We can also fashion a story of the exposures and outcomes of interest, cast in all the
richness and nuance of their specific sociohistorical context, as a historian or novelist might. This
scenario can represent the real world, as it actually occurred, rather than the absurdly simplistic
representation of the world as a regression model. (Jay Kaufman, 2019)
