## Discussion

- Main findings

Methodological considerations

 * Identifiability challenges
 
- Unmeasured confounding: For the statins paper is confounding by indication. For systolic blood pressure, comorbidities, frailty, hypertension medication. For pin1 it's just crazy

- Unmeasured confounding related to the controlled direct effect in competing events

- Consistency: 

- The tabu behind the well-defined intervention. Talk a bit about does water kill and maybe some prior concepts about consistency. In statins we assume that the effect of statins is consistent across statin types, and historically too.
In the case of blood pressure, although we mimiqued the sprint trial, we are not clear about how... problems with defining.
Mention that it is very hard to define time zero in settings of biomarkers, worse when a disease diagnosis is considered the exposure. Sometimes yes, a measurement of a biomarker may lead to an action, but in settings where the biomarker is measured in a different setting, this becomes more challenging.


Consistency has to do also with how we frame our questions, is it the ITT effect or the sustained effect?
To do this, the common challenge observed in statins and in cancer is defining the time zero
.

In statins we used a sophisticated method, but which's replicability and flexibility is not yet accessible. for example, we only addressed the cde and the combined outcome.
For the cancer, since you can only transition from one arm to the other, there is no clear time-window at best we fit IPW up to x.

Positivity. The RS included participants from x to y age and followed them throught time. Ideally, in a target trial setting we would have selected younger participants. If restrict to the first cohort, and with

Future directions

- Social determinants of health

- there are many related to dementia. a frequent one is education

- Alternative estimands for incident outcomes and competing events

* Separable effects

* Life-expectancy issues
