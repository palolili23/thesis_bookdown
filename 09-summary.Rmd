## English Summary

Given the large burden of dementia affecting population worlwide, major research efforts are taking place to identify ways to prevent and delay the onset of dementia. Several potential targets of intervention have been proposed, mostly based on large observational data, though findings have been sometimes contradictory. The aim of this thesis was to study the effect of different potential targets of intervention related to dementia prevention that have had controversial results in previous studies. To this matter, we overcame previous methodological challenges and frequent sources of bias by implementing causal inference theory and corresponding methods, such as target trial emulation and application of appropriate methods to account for time-varying confounding feedback (g-methods). To do so, we used data collected for the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort with rich longitudinal data assessment for over 20 years.

In **Chapter** \@ref(chapter2) we emulated a hypothetical randomized trial - a target trial - for estimating observational analogues to intention-to-treat ("initiating treatment" vs. "not initiating treatment") and per-protocol effects (initiating and sustained use" vs "not initiating ever") of statins in the risk of dementia. Eligibility criteria was defined in a way that allowed us to set a clear time zero, in the sense that the time that corresponds to treatment assignment, treatment initiation and start of follow-up, are aligned. We additionally conceptualized a "sequence of trials", which allowed us to assess eligibility criteria every month between 1993 and 2007, each of them with a 1-month enrollment period, increasing sample size and precision of estimates. In this study we found that individuals with sustained statin use, but not statin initiation alone, had reduced 10-year risks of dementia and dementia or death. These results highlight the need to ask and answer questions related to a per-protocol effect.

Likewise, in **Chapter** \@ref(chapter3) we emulated a target trial to estimate the sustained effect of several hypothetical interventions on systolic blood pressure (SBP) control, including in combination with an intervention on smoking cessation over follow-up, on the risk of first-ever stroke and dementia over 15 years of follow-up. By leveraging longitudinal information, and with application of the parametric *g-formula*, we were able to simulate multiple treatment arms from the same source of data. All interventions were associated with a stroke risk reduction. In contrast, we did not observe a change in the risk of dementia. In fact, all point estimates were above one. These results need to be interpreted in the context of death as a competing event. Given that we have targeted a total effect, part of the effect in the risk of dementia is mediated by how interventions reduce the risk of death.

Since "reducing blood pressure" does not represent a well-defined intervention, in **Chapter** \@ref(chapter3) we discuss the different interpretations of the consistency assumption and limitations of our results. However, this study shows how, even when we don't have measures of the specific intervention, we can still conceptualize the target trial, under clear and transparent assumptions. In **Chapter** \@ref(chapter4), we take this reasoning to disentangle the potential sources of bias that could explain the inverse association between cancer and dementia found in previous studies. To this matter, we bring the Pin-1 hypothesis as part of the research question and progressively build a causal directed acyclic graph, outlining the assumptions needed to study the effect. We highlight the challenges that arise which may introduce bias, and describe how these can be prevented (up to certain extent) through different analytic decisions. Our results show how depending on the confounding and selection bias control, and the way in which cancer was used as a time-varying proxy, the risk ratio ranges from below the null to above the null. Thus, being explicit about the underlying mechanism of interest and defining a clear causal contrast is key to maximize what we can learn about this association given available or readily-collected data, and to defining, detecting, and preventing potential biases.

Just as it is important to clearly define what we mean by the exposure or intervention of interest, a clear research question should include competing events. Given that over 30% of the participants of the Rotterdam Study died over time, prior to a dementia diagnosis, in all chapters death played the role of a competing event. Thus, we included death as part of the research question and estimated a controlled-direct effect or a total effect, depending on each research question. Given that this concepts are not well known in the applied dementia research community, to understand the current practices in terms of how competing events are handled in the design, analysis, reporting, and interpretation, we performed a systematic review of longitudinal studies focused (implicitly or explicitly) on causal effects in dementia risk in **Chapter** \@ref(chapter5). We found that the number or proportion of individuals who died over time was reported in more than half of papers, but less than 20% reported these numbers by exposure level. Almost half of studies did not include any description on how death was handled in the methods section and only 11% had a clear and complete description of how death was treated in the main analysis. The vast majority (93%) presented estimates of a hazard ratio, mostly under a Cox proportional hazards model though none reported the correct interpretation given the presence of a competing event nor discussed the assumptions related to death as a competing event. Furthermore, 86% interpreted hazard ratios as inferring something about a risk (e.g. *"the exposure increased the risk of dementia, HR:X, 95%CI"*) and only one study gave an explicit interpretation that matched the target causal parameter of interest.

To illustrate concepts in a language tailored for an applied audience, in **Chapter** \@ref(chapter6) we present a hypothetical randomized trial on smoking cessation in late-midlife, and emulate such a trial using observational data from the Rotterdam Study. We estimated a total effect of smoking cessation (compared to continued smoking) on 20-year dementia risk of 2.1 (95%CI: -0.1, 4.2) percentage points and a controlled direct effect of smoking cessation on 20-year dementia risk had death been fully prevented of -1.9 (-5.1, 1.4) percentage points. Our study highlights how different causal contrasts can result in different estimates, here going in opposite directions. Perhaps the biggest take-away of our findings, recent methodologic innovations, and our guidelines is a simple one: we cannot begin to describe "bias" due to a competing event, let alone do something about that supposed bias, without stating clearly what question we were seeking an answer for.

Chapter 7, we discuss overarching findings of this dissertation, the implications of those findings, and potential directions for future research on this topic. To conclude, in chapter 8 I reflect upon how my training as an epidemiologist and the clash with sars-cov pandemic, have forge my motivations, which will also reflect in my future steps in research.
