## English Summary

Given the large burden of dementia affecting population worlwide, major research efforts are taking place to identify ways to prevent and delay the onset of dementia. Several potential targets of intervention have been proposed, mostly based on large observational datal. However, some had contradictory results. However, previous work has mostly focused on studing the effect of these factors, although they are time-varying in nature, as time-fixed exposures. Other studies had structural sources of bias such as selecting and defining exposures without a clear definition of a time-zero. Another layer of major concer is that most studies remained ambiguous in terms of defining a clear estimand that considers death as a competing event.  The aim of this thesis was to study the effect of different potential targets of intervention related to dementia prevention that have had contradictory results in previous observational studies. To do so, we intended to overcome certain limitations from previous studies, by adopting causal inference theory and corresponding methods. To this matter, we used longitudinal data collected for the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort with over 20 years of follow up. This study has the advantage of having integrated multiple sources of data, from data collected specifically from questionnaires and clinical assessments every few years, and integration with secondary data sources such as pharmacy data, electronical clinical records and municipal data. 

In **Chapter \@ref(chapter2)** we emulated a hypothetical randomized trial - a target trial - for estimating observational analogues to intention-to-treat (“initiating treatment” vs. “not initiating treatment”) and per-protocol effects (initiating and sustained use” vs “not initiating ever”) of statins in the risk of dementia. As opposed to previous studies, participants were eligible only if they had not had a previous history of statin use in the previous two years. This criteria allowed us to set a clear time zero, in the sense that the time that corresponds to treatment assignment, treatment initiation and start of follow-up, are aligned. To overcome the limitations of selecting participants at one time-point, we conceptualized a "sequence of trials". This design allowed us to assess eligibility criteria every month between 1993 and 2007, each of them with a 1-month enrollment period. In this study we found that individuals with sustained statin use, but not statin initiation alone, had reduced 10-year risks of dementia and dementia or death. ... something about how relevant is to address a per protocol effect


In **Chapter \@ref(chapter3)** we emulated a target trial to estimate the sustained effect of several hypothetical interventions on systolic blood pressure (SBP) control, including in combination with an intervention on smoking over follow-up, on the risk of first-ever stroke and dementia using data from 15 years of follow-up in the Rotterdam Study. All interventions that involved reducing SBP were associated with a stroke risk reduction of about 10%, and joint interventions on reducing SBP and smoking cessation further decreased the risk of stroke to over 15%. In contrast, we did not observe a change in the risk of dementia. In fact, all point estimates were above one. These results need to be interpreted in the context of death as a competing event. Given that we have targeted a total effect, part of the effect in the risk of dementia is mediated by how interventions reduce the risk of death.

In Chapter 3, as opposed to chapter 2, we did not specify how we would reduce blood pressure. Ideally, we would have wanted to answer a well-defined question that explores interventions that specifically target anti-hypertensive medication, life-style and/or societal interventions. This also means that our estimates are based on the consistency assumption that lowering systolic blood pressure through any available means (e.g., dietary changes, medication use, other lifestyle changes) would have the same effect on stroke or dementia risk. Otherwise, they are, at best, interpretable as estimates for an effect of a weighted average of several systolic blood pressure - lowering strategies with weights determined by the frequency that the particular strategies occur in our specific population.

**Chapter \@ref(chapter4)**, we begin by taking a deductive reasoning approach to disentangle potential sources of bias that could explain this inverse association. To this matter, we bring the Pin-1 hypothesis to stage from the very beginning and phrase the question of interest as: _What is the effect of this Pin1-targeting drug on the risk of dementia over time compared to standard treatments?_. With this question we aimed to explore how we might learn about this effect using real-world data on cancer diagnosis and dementia. To connect this particular causal question to the observable data we progressively build a causal directed acyclic graph, outlining the assumptions needed to study the effect. We highlight the challenges that arise which may introduce bias, and describe how these can be prevented (up to certain extent) through different analytic decisions. 

Depending on the confounding and selection bias control, and the way in which cancer was used as a time-varying proxy, the risk ratio ranged from below the null to above the null. Thus, being explicit about the underlying mechanism of interest and defining a clear causal contrast is key to maximize what we can learn about this association given available or readily-collected data, and to defining, detecting, and preventing potential biases.

Just as it is important to clearly define what we mean by the exposure or intervention of interest, we must focus on other elements of a clear research question, such as how our question incorporates competing events and other censoring events. In **Chapter \@ref(chapter4)** I also discussed the challenge of having death as a competing event, and as I will discuss in more depth in the following paragraphs, when death is a competing event, the causal contrast (or estimand) of interests needs to have death as part of its definition.

**Chapter \@ref(chapter5)** is a systematic review of longitudinal studies focused (implicitly or explicitly) on causal effects in dementia risk. The aim was to summarize how death during follow-up is handled in the design, analysis, reporting, and interpretation of results. Out of 57 papers that were included, the number or proportion of individuals who died over time was reported in 56% of papers; 18% presented these numbers by exposure level. Only 11% had a clear and complete description of how death was treated in the main analysis, while 47% did not include any description on how death was handled in the methods section. The vast majority (93%) presented estimates of a hazard ratio, mostly under a Cox proportional hazards model though none reported the correct interpretation given the presence of a competing event nor discussed the assumptions related to death as a competing event. Furthermore, 86% interpreted hazard ratios as inferring something about a risk (e.g. _“the exposure increased the risk of dementia, HR:X, 95%CI”_) and only one study gave an explicit interpretation that matched the target causal parameter of interest.

To illustrate concepts in a language tailored for an applied audience, in **Chapter \@ref(chapter6)** we present a hypothetical randomized trial on smoking cessation in late-midlife, and emulate such a trial using observational data from the Rotterdam Study. We estimated a total effect of smoking cessation (compared to continued smoking) on 20-year dementia risk of 2.1 (95%CI: -0.1, 4.2) percentage points and a controlled direct effect of smoking cessation on 20-year dementia risk had death been fully prevented of -1.9 (-5.1, 1.4) percentage points. Our study highlights how different causal contrasts can result in different estimates, here going in opposite directions. Perhaps the biggest take-away of our findings, recent methodologic innovations, and our guidelines is a simple one: we cannot begin to describe "bias" due to a competing event, let alone do something about that supposed bias, without stating clearly what question we were seeking an answer for.

Chapter 7, we discuss overarching findings of this dissertation, the implications of those findings, and potential directions for future research on this topic. To conclude, in chapter 8 I reflect upon how my training as an epidemiologist and the clash with sars-cov pandemic, have forge my motivations, which will also reflect in my future steps in research.
