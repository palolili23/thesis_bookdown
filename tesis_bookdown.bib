  abstract = {Summary Background This programme of overviews of randomised trials was established to investigate the effects of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and other blood-pressure-lowering drugs on mortality and major cardiovascular morbidity in several populations of patients. We did separate overviews of trials comparing active treatment regimens with placebo, trials comparing more intensive and less intensive blood-pressure-lowering strategies, and trials comparing treatment regimens based on different drug classes. Methods The hypotheses to be investigated, the trials to be included, and the outcomes to be studied were all selected before the results of any participating trial were known. Individual participant data or group tabular data were provided by each trial and combined by standard statistical techniques. Findings The overview of placebo-controlled trials of ACE inhibitors (four trials, 12\hphantom{,}124 patients mostly with coronary heart disease) revealed reductions in stroke (30\% [95\% Cl 15\textendash 43]), coronary heart disease (20\% [11\textendash 28]), and major cardiovascular events (21\% [14\textendash 27]). The overview of placebo-controlled trials of calcium antagonists (two trials, 5520 patients mostly with hypertension) showed reductions in stroke (39\% [15\textendash 56]) and major cardiovascular events (28\% [13\textendash 41]). In the overview of trials comparing blood-pressure-lowering strategies of different intensity (three trials, 20\hphantom{,}408 patients with hypertension), there were reduced risks of stroke (20\% [2\textendash 35]), coronary heart disease (19\% [2\textendash 33]), and major cardiovascular events (15\% [4\textendash 24]) with more intensive therapy. In the overviews comparing different antihypertensive regimens (eight trials, 37\hphantom{,}872 patients with hypertension), several differences in cause-specific effects were seen between calcium-antagonist-based therapy and other regimens, but each was of borderline significance. Interpretation Strong evidence of benefits of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists is provided by the overviews of placebo-controlled trials. There is weaker evidence of differences between treatment regimens of differing intensities and of differences between treatment regimens based on different drug classes. Data from continuing trials of blood-pressure-lowering drugs will substantially increase the evidence available about any real differences that might exist between regimens.}

  abstract = {Background\textemdash Cerebral microbleeds are highly prevalent in people with clinically manifest cerebrovascular disease and have been shown to increase the risk of stroke recurrence. Microbleeds are also frequently found in healthy elderly, a population in which the clinical implication of microbleeds is unknown. Methods and Results\textemdash In the population-based Rotterdam Study, the presence, number, and location of microbleeds were assessed at baseline on brain MRI of 4759 participants aged {$\geq$}45 years. Participants were followed for incident stroke throughout the study period (2005\textendash 2013). We used Cox proportional hazards to investigate if people with microbleeds were at increased risk of stroke in comparison with those without microbleeds, adjusting for demographic, genetic, and cardiovascular risk, and cerebrovascular imaging markers. Microbleed prevalence was 18.7\% (median count 1 [1\textendash 111]). During mean follow-up of 4.9 years (standard deviation, 1.6) 93 strokes occurred (72 ischemic, 11 hemorrhagic, and 10 unspecified). Microbleed presence was associated with an increased risk of all strokes (hazard ratio, 1.93; 95\% confidence interval, 1.25\textendash 2.99). The risk increased with greater microbleed count. In comparison with those without microbleeds, participants with microbleeds in locations suggestive of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (lobar with or without cerebellar microbleeds) were at increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (hazard ratio, 5.27; 95\% confidence interval, 1.38\textendash 20.23). Microbleeds at other locations were associated with an increased risk of both ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage. Conclusions\textemdash Microbleeds on MRI are associated with an increased risk of stroke in the general population. Our results strengthen the notion that microbleeds mark progression of cerebrovascular pathology and represent a precursor of stroke.\hspace{0.6em}\,(Circulation. 2015;132:509-516.

Cognitive performance (global cognitive functioning, visual memory, verbal fluency, psychomotor speed, and executive function), clinical diagnosis of dementia, and fibrate and statin use, were evaluated at baseline, and 2, 4, and 7 year follow-up. Multivariate Cox models were stratified by gender and adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, mental and physical health including vascular risk factors, and genetic vulnerability (apolipoprotein E and cholesteryl ester transfer protein). For women but not men, fibrate use was specifically associated with an increased risk over 7 years of decline in visual memory only (HR = 1.29, 95\% CI = 1.09\textendash 1.54, p = 0.004), and did not increase risk for incident dementia. This association was independent of genetic vulnerability related to apolipoprotein E and cholesteryl exchange transfer protein polymorphisms and occurred only in women with higher low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels and treated with fibrate (HR = 1.39, 95\% CI = 1.08\textendash 1.79, p = 0.01) and not in those with lower LDL-cholesterol levels irrespective of fibrate treatment. For both genders, no significant associations were found between statins (irrespective of their lipophilicity) and either cognitive decline or dementia incidence. This prospective study, adjusting for multiple confounders, found no evidence that LLA given in late life reduced the risk of cognitive decline and dementia, but did raise the possibility that women with treatment-resistant high LDL-cholesterol may be at increased risk of decline in visual memory.},

Methods: Participants were 929 older Catholic clergy (68.7\% women, mean baseline age 74.9 years, education 18.2 years, Mini-Mental State Examination 28.5) free of dementia, enrolled in the Religious Orders Study, a longitudinal clinical-pathologic study of AD. All agreed to brain autopsy at time of death and underwent annual structured clinical evaluations, allowing for classification of AD and assessment of cognition (based on 19 neuropsychological tests). Statins were identified by direct medication inspection. Neuropathologic data were available on 262 participants. All macroscopic chronic cerebral infarctions were recorded. A measure of global AD pathology was derived from silver stain, and separate measures of amyloid and tangles were based on immunohistochemistry. We examined the relation of statins to incident AD using Cox proportional hazards, change in cognition using mixed effects models, and pathologic indices using logistic and linear regression. Results: Statin use at baseline (12.8\%) was not associated with incident AD (191 persons, up to 12 follow-up years), change in global cognition, or five separate cognitive domains (all p values Ͼ 0.20). Statin use any time prior to death (17.9\%) was not related to global AD pathology. Persons taking statins were less likely to have amyloid (p ϭ 0.02). However, among those with amyloid, there was no relation of statins to amyloid load. Statins were not related to tangles or infarction. Conclusions: Overall, statins were not related to incident Alzheimer disease (AD) or change in cognition, or continuous measures of AD pathology or infarction.

Transcriptional profiling offers a new and highly efficient approach to the identification of novel candidates for repositioning and repurposing. In the future, novel AD transcriptional signatures from cells isolated at early stages of disease, or from human neurons or microglia that carry mutations that increase the risk of AD, might be used as probes to identify additional candidate drugs. Phase II trials assessing repurposed agents must consider the best target population for a specific candidate therapy as well as the mechanism of action of the treatment. In this Review, we highlight promising compounds to prioritize for clinical trials in individuals with AD, and discuss the value of Delphi consensus methodology and evidence-based reviews to inform this prioritization process. We also describe emerging work, focusing on the potential value of transcript signatures as a cost-e ffective approach to the identification of novel candidates for repositioning.},

  abstract = {Objective: To examine the association of statin drug use on cognitive and MRI change in older adults. Methods: Participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study, a longitudinal study of people age 65 or older, were classified into three groups determined by whether they were taking statin drugs on a continuous basis, intermittently, or not at all. The untreated group was further divided into categories based on National Cholesterol Education Program recommendations for lipid-lowering treatment. Participants with prevalent or incident clinical TIA or stroke or with baseline Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) scores at or below 80 were excluded. Outcomes examined included rate of change on the 3MS over an average observational period of 7 years, along with changes in MRI white matter grade and measures of atrophy. Results: Three thousand three hundred thirty-four participants had adequate data for analysis. At baseline, the untreated group in which lipid-lowering drug treatment was recommended were slightly older, less likely to be on estrogen replacement, and had higher serum cholesterol and lower 3MS scores than the statin-treated group. The rate of decline on the 3MS was 0.48 point/year less in those taking statins compared with the untreated group for which treatment was recommended (p ϭ 0.069) and 0.49 point/year less in statin users compared with the group in which lipid-lowering treatment was not recommended (p ϭ 0.009). This effect remained after controlling for serum cholesterol levels. One thousand seven hundred thirty participants with baseline 3MS scores of Ͼ80 underwent cranial MRI scans on two occasions separated by 5 years. There was no significant difference in white matter grade change or atrophy measures between groups. Conclusion: Statin drug use was associated with a slight reduction in cognitive decline in an elderly population. This relationship could not be completely explained by the effect of statins on lowering of serum cholesterol.},

Methods 1604 and 1345 eligible participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) were followed after age 50 for a median time of around 25 years, to examine the incidence of dementia (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}259) and MCI (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}138), respectively. Statin use (ever-use and time-dependent use), total cholesterol levels (TC; first visit and time-dependent), TC change trajectory from first visit and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C):TC ratio (first visit and time-dependent) were the main exposures of interest. Cox proportional hazards models were used. Results Participants with incident dementia had a higher first-visit TC compared with participants who remained free of dementia and MCI, while first-visit TC was higher among statin ever-users compared with never-users (age-unadjusted associations). Statin users had a twoto threefold lower risk of developing dementia (HR{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.41; 95\% CI 0.18 to 0.92), but not MCI, when considering time-dependent `statin use' with propensity score model adjustment. This association remained significant independently of serum cholesterol exposures. An elevated first-visit TC was associated with reduced MCI risk (upper quartile (Q4) vs Q1: HR{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.51; 95\% CI 0.29 to 0.90). Compared with the lowest quartile (Q1: 0.00e0.19), HDL-C:TC (time-dependent) in (Q2: 0.19e0.24) was associated with reduced MCI risk (HR{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.58; 95\% CI 0.34 to 0.98). Among men only, TC decline from first visit was significantly associated with increased dementia risk (HR{$\frac{1}{4}$}4.21; 95\% CI 1.28 to 13.85). Conclusions Statins may have multifactorial effects on dementia but not MCI risk. Future interventions may be warranted, and research should focus on optimal serum TC, HDL-C:TC ratio and TC change trajectories.},

Participants without known cardiovascular disease or need for treatment were randomized to candesartan (16 mg) plus hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) or placebo and to rosuvastatin (10 mg) or placebo. Participants who were {$\geq$}70 years of age completed the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), the modified Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and the Trail Making Test Part B at baseline and study end. Results Cognitive assessments were completed by 2,361 participants from 228 centers in 21 countries. Compared with placebo, candesartan/hydrochlorothiazide reduced systolic blood pressure by 6.0 mm Hg, and rosuvastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 24.8 mg/dL. Participants were followed up for 5.7 years (median), and 1,626 completed both baseline and study-end assessments. Mean participant age was 74 years (SD {$\pm$}3.5 years); 59\% were women; 45\% had hypertension; and 24\% had {$\geq$}12 years of education.

We applied this method to data from the French Hospital database on HIV (FHDH-ANRS CO4), an observational study of HIV-infected patients, in order to compare dynamic regimes of the form ``initiate treatment within m months after the recorded CD4 cell count first drops below x cells/mm3" where x takes values from 200 to 500 in increments of 10 and m takes values 0 or 3. We describe the method in the context of this example and discuss some complications that arise in emulating a randomized experiment using observational data.},

Treatment switching strategies are often dynamic because the time of switching depends on the evolution of an individual's time-varying covariates. Dynamic strategies can be directly compared in randomized trials. For example, HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy could be randomized to switching therapy within 90 days of HIV-1 RNA crossing above a threshold of either 400 copies/ml (tight-control strategy) or 1000 copies/ml (loose-control strategy).},

  abstract = {Objective: Observational data can be used to attempt to emulate a target trial of statin use and estimate analogues of intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects on dementia risk. Methods: Using data from a prospective cohort study in the Netherlands, we conceptualized a sequence of ``trials'' in which eligible individuals ages 55-80 years were classified as statin D initiators or non-initiators for every consecutive month between 1993 and 2007 and were followed until diagnosis of dementia, death, loss to follow-up, or the end of follow-up. We E estimated two types of effects of statin use on dementia and a combined endpoint of dementia or death: the effect of initiation versus no initiation and the effect of sustained use versus no use. T We estimated risk by statin treatment strategy over time via pooled logistic regression. We used P inverse-probability weighting to account for treatment-confounder feedback in estimation of perprotocol effects. E Results: Of 233,526 eligible person-trials (6,373 individuals), there were 622 initiators and 232,904 non-initiators. Comparing statin initiation with no initiation, the 10-year risk differences C (95\% CI) were -0.1\% (-2.3\%, 1.8\%) for dementia and 0.3\% (-2.7\%, 3.3\%) for dementia or death. Comparing sustained statin use versus no use, the 10-year risk differences were -2.2\% (-5.2\%, AC 1.6\%) for dementia and -5.1\% (-10.5\%, -1.1\%) for dementia or death. Conclusions: Individuals with sustained statin use, but not statin initiation alone, had reduced 10-year risks of dementia and dementia or death. Our results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of initiators and events, and potential for residual confounding.},

Little is known about the impact of multiple lifestyle factors on the risk of stroke. Methods and Results\textemdash We conducted a prospective cohort study among 43 685 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and 71 243 women from the Nurses' Health Study. Diet and other lifestyle factors were updated from self-reported questionnaires. We defined a low-risk lifestyle as not smoking, a body mass index Ͻ25 kg/m2, Ն30 min/d of moderate activity, modest alcohol consumption (men, 5 to 30 g/d; women, 5 to 15 g/d), and scoring within the top 40\% of a healthy diet score. We documented 1559 strokes (853 ischemic, 278 hemorrhagic) among women and 994 strokes (600 ischemic, 161 hemorrhagic) among men during follow-up. Women with all 5 low-risk factors had a relative risk of 0.21 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.12, 0.36) for total and 0.19 (95\% CI, 0.09, 0.40) for ischemic stroke compared with women who had none of these factors. Among men, the relative risks were 0.31 (95\% CI, 0.19, 0.53) for total and 0.20 (95\% CI, 0.10, 0.42) for ischemic stroke for the same comparison. Among the women, 47\% (95\% CI, 18 to 69) of total and 54\% (95\% CI, 15 to 78\%) of ischemic stroke cases were attributable to lack of adherence to a low-risk lifestyle; among the men, 35\% (95\% CI, 7 to 58) of total and 52\% (95\% CI, 19 to 75) of ischemic stroke may have been prevented.

However, an U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued health alert has raised concerns for the adverse effects of statin-associated confusion and memory loss in the elderly people. It is necessary to clarify the relationship between statin use and risk of incident dementia as well as whether class effects exist. Methods: In this population-based retrospective cohort study, total 33,398 patients aged {$\geq$} 60 years were selected from a subset of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Databases and followed up for tracking the occurrence of any type of dementia from 2000 to 2010. The Cox proportional hazards models were used. Results: Compared to nonusers, statin users had a significantly lower risk of incident dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.72\textendash 0.85, p b 0.001). The potency and the cumulative duration of statin utilized were associated with the reducing risk of dementia. After stratifying by gender, the risk of incident dementia was lower in female statin users (HR, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.68\textendash 0.85, p b 0.001) than in male statin users (HR, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.75\textendash 0.98, p = 0.024). Higher potency and longer cumulative duration of statin use were required for reducing the risk of incident dementia in male patients than in female patients. Conclusion: Statin use was associated with a significantly lower risk of dementia in the elderly patients in Taiwan. The potency and the cumulative duration of statin utilized played critical roles. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This study aimed to test the association between use of statins and incidence of dementia and cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND) over 5 years of follow-up. Methods: Data were from a population-based cohort study comprising 1,789 older Mexican Americans. All participants had cognitive and clinical evaluations performed every 12 to 15 months. Participants who fell below specified cutpoints on cognitive tests were then evaluated clinically. Dementia diagnoses were finalized by an adjudication team. A total of 1,674 participants free of dementia/CIND at baseline were included in these analyses. Statin use was verified at each participant's home by medicine cabinet inspection. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between statin use and incidence of dementia/CIND. Results: Overall, 452 of 1,674 participants (27\%) took statins at any time during the study. Over the 5-year follow-up period, 130 participants developed dementia/CIND. In Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for education, smoking status, presence of at least one APOE ␧4 allele, and history of stroke or diabetes at baseline, persons who had used statins were about half as likely as those who did not use statins to develop dementia/CIND (HR ϭ 0.52; 95\% CI 0.34, 0.80). Conclusion: Statin users were less likely to have incident dementia/cognitive impairment without dementia during a 5-year follow-up.

Prospective studies have examined the associations between lifestyle factors and diabetes in healthy populations but have not characterized the intervention. We estimated the long-term effects of hypothetical lifestyle interventions on diabetes in a prospective study of healthy women, using the parametric g-formula. Methods: Using data from the Nurses' Health Study, we followed 76,402 women from 1984 to 2008. We estimated the risk of type 2 diabetes under eight hypothetical interventions: quitting smoking, losing weight by 5\% every 2 years if overweight/obese, exercising at least 30 minutes a day, eating less than three servings a week of red meat, eating at least two servings a day of whole grain, drinking two or more cups of coffee a day, drinking five or more grams of alcohol a day, and drinking less than one serving of soda a week. Results: The 24-year risk of diabetes was 9.6\% under no intervention and 4.3\% when all interventions were imposed (55\% lower risk [95\% confidence interval = 47 to 63\%]). The most effective interventions were weight loss (24\% lower risk), physical activity (19\%), and moderate alcohol use (19\%). Overweight/obese women would benefit the most, with 10.8 percentage point reduction in 24-year risk of diabetes. The validity of these estimates relies on the absence of unmeasured confounding, measurement error, and model misspecification. Conclusion: A combination of dietary and nondietary lifestyle modifications, begun in midlife or later in relatively healthy women, could have prevented at least half of the cases of type 2 diabetes in this cohort of U.S. women.},

The basic idea is using an observational study to emulate a hypothetical randomised trial by comparing initiators versus non-initiators of treatment. After adjustment for measured baseline confounders, one can then conduct the observational analogue of an intention-to-treat analysis. We also explain two approaches to conduct the analogues of per-protocol and as-treated analyses after further adjusting for measured timevarying confounding and selection bias using inverse-probability weighting. As an example, we implemented these methods to estimate the effect of statins for primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) using data from electronic medical records in the UK. Despite strong confounding by indication, our approach detected a potential benefit of statin therapy. The analogue of the intention-totreat hazard ratio (HR) of CHD was 0.89 (0.73, 1.09) for statin initiators versus non-initiators. The HR of CHD was 0.84 (0.54, 1.30) in the per-protocol analysis and 0.79 (0.41, 1.41) in the as-treated analysis for 2 years of use versus no use. In contrast, a conventional comparison of current users versus never users of statin therapy resulted in a HR of 1.31 (1.04, 1.66). We provide a flexible and annotated SAS program to implement the proposed analyses.},

When censoring nonadherent person-times, the per-protocol mortality hazard ratio was 0.74 (0.64, 0.85) for statins vs. no treatment, 0.55 (0.35, 0.87) for statins plus antihypertensives vs. no treatment, and 1.13 (0.88, 1.45) for atorvastatin vs. simvastatin. We estimated per-protocol hazard ratios for a 5-year treatment using different dose-response marginal structural models and standardized survival curves for each target trial using intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Conclusion: When randomized trials are not available or feasible, observational analyses can emulate a variety of target trials. \'O 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Summary Background The treatment of ischaemic stroke with neuroprotective drugs has been unsuccessful, and whether these compounds can be used to reduce disability after recurrent stroke is unknown. The putative neuroprotective effects of antiplatelet compounds and the angiotensin II receptor antagonist telmisartan were investigated in the Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes (PRoFESS) trial. Methods Patients who had had an ischaemic stroke were randomly assigned in a two by two factorial design to receive either 25 mg aspirin (ASA) and 200 mg extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) twice a day or 75 mg clopidogrel once a day, and either 80 mg telmisartan or placebo once per day. The predefined endpoints for this substudy were disability after a recurrent stroke, assessed with the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and Barthel index at 3 months, and cognitive function, assessed with the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score at 4 weeks after randomisation and at the penultimate visit. Analysis was by intention to treat. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NTC00153062. Findings 20\hphantom{,}332 patients (mean age 66 years) were randomised and followed-up for a median of 2{$\cdot$}4 years. Recurrent strokes occurred in 916 (9\%) patients randomly assigned to ASA with ER-DP and 898 (9\%) patients randomly assigned to clopidogrel; 880 (9\%) patients randomly assigned to telmisartan and 934 (9\%) patients given placebo had recurrent strokes. mRS scores were not statistically different in patients with recurrent stroke who were treated with ASA and ER-DP versus clopidogrel (p=0{$\cdot$}38), or with telmisartan versus placebo (p=0{$\cdot$}61). There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with recurrent stroke with a good outcome, as measured with the Barthel index, across all treatment groups. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the median MMSE scores, the percentage of patients with an MMSE score of 24 points or less, the percentage of patients with a drop in MMSE score of 3 points or more between 1 month and the penultimate visit, and the number of patients with dementia among the treatment groups. There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients with cognitive impairment or dementia among the treatment groups. Interpretation Disability due to recurrent stroke and cognitive decline in patients with ischaemic stroke were not different between the two antiplatelet regimens and were not affected by the preventive use of telmisartan.

Their systolic blood pressure at entry was 160 to 219 mm Hg, with diastolic blood pressure below 95 mm Hg. Antihypertensive therapy was started immediately after randomization in the active treatment group, but only after termination of the double-blind trial in the control patients. Treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/d), with the possible addition of enalapril maleate (5-20 mg/d), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/d), or both add-on drugs.Median follow-up increased from 2.0 years in the double-blind trial to 3.9 years overall. The incidence of dementia doubled from 32 to 64 cases, 41 of whom had Alzheimer disease. Throughout follow-up, systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 7.0/3.2 mm Hg higher in the 1417 control patients than in the 1485 subjects randomized to active treatment. At the last examination, the blood pressure difference was still 4.2/2.9 mm Hg; 48.1\%, 26.4\%, and 11.4\% of the control patients were taking nitrendipine, enalapril, and/or hydrochlorothiazide, whereas in the active treatment group these proportions were 70.2\%, 35.4\%, and 18.4\%, respectively. Compared with the controls, long-term antihypertensive therapy reduced the risk of dementia by 55\%, from 7.4 to 3.3 cases per 1000 patient-years (43 vs 21 cases, P\&lt;.001). After adjustment for sex, age, education, and entry blood pressure, the relative hazard rate associated with the use of nitrendipine was 0.38 (95\% confidence interval, 0.23-0.64; P\&lt;.001). Treatment of 1000 patients for 5 years can prevent 20 cases of dementia (95\% confidence interval, 7-33).The extended follow-up of Syst-Eur patients reinforces the evidence that blood pressure\textendash lowering therapy initiated with a long-acting dihydropyridine protects against dementia in older patients with systolic hypertension.Arch Intern Med. 2002;162:2046-2052--{$>$}}

Moreover, it is unclear whether the association differs for lipohilic statins, those that could more easily pass the blood\textendash brain barrier and hydrophilic statins. Objectives: To prospectively evaluate whether use of statins is associated with the risk of AD, and to determine whether associations differ for lipophilic and hydrophilic statins. Method: 6992 participants of the prospective, population-based Rotterdam Study were followed, from baseline (1990\textendash 1993) until January 2005 for incident AD. Data on all filled prescriptions came from pharmacy records. For each date on which each event occurred, cholesterollowering drug use for the person who experienced the event and all remaining persons in the cohort was categorised as ``any'' or ``never'' use. A distinction was made between statin, lipophilic and hydrophilic statins, and non-statin cholesterol-lowering drugs. Data were analysed with the Cox regression analysis, adjusting for sex, age and potential confounders. Results: During follow-up (mean 9 years), 582 persons developed AD. Compared with never use of cholesterollowering drugs, statin use was associated with a decreased risk of AD (HR 0.57; 95\% CI 0.37 to 0.90), but non-statin cholesterol-lowering drug use was not (HR 1.05; 95\% CI 0.45 to 2.44). HRs were equal for lipophilic (HR 0.54; 95\% CI 0.32 to 0.89) and hydrophilic statins (HR 0.54; 95\% CI 0.26 to 1.11). Conclusion: In the general population, the use of statins, but not of non-statin cholesterol-lowering drugs, was associated with a lower risk of AD compared with never use of cholesterol-lowering drugs. The protective effect was independent of the lipophilicity of statins.},

  abstract = {Background The intention-to-treat comparison is the primary, if not the only, analytic approach of many randomized clinical trials. Purpose To review the shortcomings of intention-to-treat analyses, and of `as treated' and `per protocol' analyses as commonly implemented, with an emphasis on problems that are especially relevant for comparative effectiveness research. Methods and Results In placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials, intentionto-treat analyses underestimate the treatment effect and are therefore nonconservative for both safety trials and noninferiority trials. In randomized clinical trials with an active comparator, intention-to-treat estimates can overestimate a treatment's effect in the presence of differential adherence. In either case, there is no guarantee that an intention-to-treat analysis estimates the clinical effectiveness of treatment. Inverse probability weighting, g-estimation, and instrumental variable estimation can reduce the bias introduced by nonadherence and loss to follow-up in `as treated' and `per protocol' analyses. Limitations These analyse require untestable assumptions, a dose-response model, and time-varying data on confounders and adherence. Conclusions We recommend that all randomized clinical trials with substantial lack of adherence or loss to follow-up are analyzed using different methods. These include an intention-to-treat analysis to estimate the effect of assigned treatment and `as treated' and `per protocol' analyses to estimate the effect of treatment after appropriate adjustment via inverse probability weighting or g-estimation.

This paper extends the usual counterfactual framework to consider causal questions about compound treatments for which there are many possible implementations (for example, ``prevention of obesity''). We describe the causal effect of compound treatments and their identifiability conditions, with a special emphasis on the consistency condition. We then discuss the challenges of using the estimated effect of a compound treatment in one study population to inform decisions in the same population and in other populations. These challenges arise because the causal effect of compound treatments depends on the distribution of the versions of treatment in the population. Such causal effects can be unpredictable when the versions of treatment are unknown. We discuss how such issues of ``transportability'' are related to the consistency condition in causal inference. With more carefully framed questions, the results of epidemiologic studies can be of greater value to decision-makers.},

This difficulty stems from the fact that frequently employed analytic techniques require that common causes of survival and the outcome are accurately measured. Unfortunately, such common causes are often unmeasured or poorly measured in racial health disparities studies. In the absence of accurate measures of the aforementioned common causes, redefining the target population or changing the study design represents a useful approach for reducing the extent of survival-related selection bias. To help researchers recognize and minimize survival-related selection bias in racial health disparities studies, we illustrate the aforementioned selection bias and how redefining the target population or changing the study design can be useful.},

The control groups consisted of either placebo, alternative antihypertensive agents, or higher blood pressure targets. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were screened and extracted independently by 2 authors. Random-effects meta-analysis models were used to report pooled treatment effects and CIs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was dementia or cognitive impairment. The secondary outcomes were cognitive decline and changes in cognitive test scores. RESULTS Fourteen randomized clinical trials were eligible for inclusion (96 158 participants), of which 12 reported the incidence of dementia (or composite of dementia and cognitive impairment [3 trials]) on follow-up and were included in the primary meta-analysis, 8 reported cognitive decline, and 8 reported changes in cognitive test scores. The mean (SD) age of trial participants was 69 (5.4) years and 40 617 (42.2\%) were women. The mean systolic baseline blood pressure was 154 (14.9) mm Hg and the mean diastolic blood pressure was 83.3 (9.9) mm Hg. The mean duration of follow-up was 49.2 months. Blood pressure lowering with antihypertensive agents compared with control was significantly associated with a reduced risk of dementia or cognitive impairment (12 trials; 92 135 participants) (7.0\% vs 7.5\% of patients over a mean trial follow-up of 4.1 years; odds ratio [OR], 0.93 [95\% CI, 0.88-0.98]; absolute risk reduction, 0.39\% [95\% CI, 0.09\%-0.68\%]; I2 = 0.0\%) and cognitive decline (8 trials) (20.2\% vs 21.1\% of participants over a mean trial follow-up of 4.1 years; OR, 0.93 [95\% CI, 0.88-0.99]; absolute risk reduction, 0.71\% [95\% CI, 0.19\%-1.2\%]; I2 = 36.1\%). Blood pressure lowering was not significantly associated with a change in cognitive test scores. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, blood pressure lowering with antihypertensive agents compared with control was significantly associated with a lower risk of incident dementia or cognitive impairment.},

Revisiting prior analyses in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth on disparities in wages, unemployment, incarceration, and overall health with test scores, taken as a proxy for educational attainment, as a target intervention, we propose and demonstrate a novel decomposition that controls for confounders of test scores (e.g., measures of childhood socioeconomic status [SES]) while leaving their association with race intact. We compare this decomposition with others that use standardization (to equalize childhood SES [the confounders] alone), mediation analysis (to equalize test scores within levels of childhood SES), and one that equalizes both childhood SES and test scores. We also show how these decompositions, including our novel proposals, are equivalent to implementations of the Oaxaca\textendash Blinder decomposition but provide a more formal causal interpretation for these decompositions.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A society's social structure and the interactions of its members determine when key drivers of health occur, for how long they last, and how they operate. Yet, it has been unclear whether causal inference methods can help us find meaningful interventions on these fundamental social drivers of health. Galea and Hern\'an propose we place hypothetical interventions on a spectrum and estimate their effects by emulating trials, either through individual-level data analysis or systems science modeling (Am J Epidemiol. 2020;189(3):167\textendash 170). In this commentary, by way of example in health disparities research, we probe this ``closer engagement of social epidemiology with formal causal inference approaches.'' The formidable, but not insurmountable, tensions call for causal reasoning and effect estimation in social epidemiology that should always be enveloped by a thorough understanding of how systems and the social exposome shape risk factor and health distributions. We argue that one way toward progress is a true partnership of social epidemiology and causal inference with bilateral feedback aimed at integrating social epidemiologic theory, causal identification and modeling methods, systems thinking, and improved study design and data. To produce consequential work, we must make social epidemiology more causal and causal inference more social.},

  abstract = {Causal decomposition analyses can help build the evidence base for interventions that address health disparities (inequities). They ask how disparities in outcomes may change under hypothetical intervention. Through study design and assumptions, they can rule out alternate explanations such as confounding, selection bias, and measurement error, thereby identifying potential targets for intervention. Unfortunately, the literature on causal decomposition analysis and related methods have largely ignored equity concerns that actual interventionists would respect, limiting their relevance and practical value. This article addresses these concerns by explicitly considering what covariates the outcome disparity and hypothetical intervention adjust for (so-called allowable covariates) and the equity value judgments these choices convey, drawing from the bioethics, biostatistics, epidemiology, and health services research literatures. From this discussion, we generalize decomposition estimands and formulae to incorporate allowable covariate sets (and thereby reflect equity choices) while still allowing for adjustment of non-allowable covariates needed to satisfy causal assumptions. For these general formulae, we provide weightingbased estimators based on adaptations of ratio-of-mediator-probability and inverse-odds-ratio weighting. We discuss when these estimators reduce to already used estimators under certain equity value judgments, and a novel adaptation under other judgments.},

There is currently no disease-modifying treatment though several symptomatic medications exist with modest benefit on cognition. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have a consistent benefit across all stages of dementia; their benefit in mild cognitive impairment and prodromal AD is unproven. Memantine has a smaller benefit on cognition overall which is limited to the moderate to severe stages, and the combination of a cholinesterase inhibitor and memantine may have additional efficacy. Evidence for the efficacy of vitamin E supplementation and medical foods is weak but might be considered in the context of cost, availability, and safety in individual patients. Apparently promising disease-modifying interventions, mostly addressing the amyloid cascade hypothesis of AD, have recently failed to demonstrate efficacy so novel approaches must be considered.},

When investigators design such studies, how important is it to follow patients from the day they initiated treatment with the study interventions? Our article considers this question and related issues to start a dialogue on the value of the incident user design in comparative effectiveness research. By incident user design, we mean a study that sets the cohort's inception date according to patients' new use of an intervention. In contrast, most epidemiologic studies enroll patients who were currently or recently using an intervention when follow-up began. We take the incident user design as a reasonable default strategy because it reduces biases that can impact non-randomized studies, especially when investigators use healthcare databases. We review case studies where investigators have explored the consequences of designing a cohort study by restricting to incident users, but most of the discussion has been informed by expert opinion, not by systematic evidence.

  abstract = {Objective: To assess the association between statin therapy and risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) in a prospective cohort study with documented statin exposure and incident dementia. Methods: This is a prospective, cohort study of statin use and incident dementia and probable AD. A cohort of 2,356 cognitively intact persons, aged 65 and older, were randomly selected from a health maintenance organization (HMO), and were assessed biennially for dementia. Statin use was identified using the HMO pharmacy database. A proportional hazards model with statin use as a time-dependent covariate was used to assess the statin\textendash{} dementia/AD association. Results: Among 312 participants with incident dementia, 168 had probable AD. The unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with statin use were 1.33 (95\% CI 0.95 to 1.85) for all-cause dementia and 0.90 (CI 0.54 to 1.51) for probable AD. Adjusted corresponding HRs were 1.19 (CI 0.82 to 1.75) and 0.82 (CI 0.46 to 1.46). A subgroup analysis of participants with at least one APOE-⑀4 allele who entered the study before age 80 produced an adjusted HR of 0.33 (CI 0.10 to 1.04). Conclusion: Employing time-dependent proportional hazards modeling, the authors found no significant association between statin use and incident dementia or probable AD. In contrast, when the data were analyzed, inappropriately, as a case-control study, the authors found an OR of 0.55 for probable AD, falsely indicating a protective effect of statins. Study design and analytic methods may explain the discrepancy between the current null findings and earlier findings.},

We propose a 3-step procedure to facilitate meaningful comparisons of effect estimates from randomized trials and observational studies: 1) harmonization of the study protocols (eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, outcome, start and end of follow-up, causal contrast) so that the studies target the same causal effect, 2) harmonization of the data analysis to estimate the causal effect, and 3) sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact of discrepancies that could not be accounted for in the harmonization process. To illustrate our approach, we compared estimates of the effect of immediate with deferred initiation of antiretroviral therapy in individuals positive for the human immunodeficiency virus from the Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Therapy (START) randomized trial and the observational HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration.},

  abstract = {Background: Guidance reports for observational comparative effectiveness and drug safety research recommend implementing a new-user design whenever possible, since it reduces the risk of selection bias in exposure effect estimation compared to a prevalent-user design. The uptake of this guidance has not been studied extensively. Methods: We reviewed 89 observational effectiveness and safety cohort studies published in six pharmacoepidemiological journals in 2018 and 2019. We developed an extraction tool to assess how frequently new-user and prevalent-user designs were reported to be implemented. For studies that implemented a new-user design in both treatment arms, we extracted information about the extent to which the moment of meeting eligibility criteria, treatment initiation, and start of follow-up were reported to be aligned. Results: Of the 89 studies included, 40\% reported implementing a new-user design for both the study exposure arm and the comparator arm, while 13\% reported implementing a prevalent-user design in both arms. The moment of meeting eligibility criteria, treatment initiation, and start of follow-up were reported to be aligned in both treatment arms in 53\% of studies that reported implementing a new-user design. We provided examples of studies that minimized the risk of introducing bias due to unclear definition of time origin in unexposed participants, immortal time, or a time lag. Conclusions: Almost half of the included studies reported implementing a new-user design. Implications of misalignment of study design origin were difficult to assess because it would require explicit reporting of the target estimand in original studies. We recommend that the choice for a particular study time origin is explicitly motivated to enable assessment of validity of the study.},

  abstract = {Methods Data were obtained from the PHARMO-database, comprising pharmacy records of approximately 300 000 people in The Netherlands. In the period from 1991\textendash 98, we estimated prevalence of lipid lowering drug use on the first Wednesday of October. A patient was defined as incident user if (s)he filled a prescription for lipid lowering medication after a 360 days lipid lowering drug free interval. Both prevalence and incidence estimates were weighted for the sex and age distribution of the general Dutch population. Results From 1991 to 1998, the prevalence of lipid lowering drug use increased from 0.5\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.5, 0.6) to 2.3\% (95\% CI: 2.2, 2.4) in women and from 0.6\% (95\% CI: 0.6, 0.6) to 2.9\% (95\% CI: 2.8, 3.0) in men. Prevalence increased with increasing age and was highest in the age category 60\textendash 69 years (in 1998: 9.9\% (95\% CI: 9.4, 10.4) in women and 11.6\% (95\% CI: 11.0, 12.1) in men). In 1992, the estimated incidence of lipid lowering drug use was 251(95\% CI: 226, 277)/100 000 person years in women and 251(95\% CI: 225, 276)/100 000 person years in men. The largest incidence estimates were observed in 1996 (685(95\% CI: 644, 726)/ 100 000 person years in women and 881(95\% CI: 834, 928)/100 000 person years in men). After 1996, incidence stabilized in 1997 and decreased in 1998 to 599(561, 637)/100 000 person years in women and 731(688, 773)/100 000 person years in men. Most of the patients (approximately 95\%) were treated with one lipid lowering agent. Statins were used by over 90\% of patients from 1996 onwards. In 1998, 35\% of the patients started with a statin that was not a first choice drug (mainly atorvastatin). Conclusions In the period from 1991\textendash 98, prevalence of lipid lowering drug use significantly increased in The Netherlands. However, incidence stabilized and decreased after 1996 which may be explained by the fact that the number of patients eligible for treatment was reached. The question remains whether lipid lowering medication was targeted to the appropriate patients.},

  abstract = {Background: The relationship between education and late-life cognitive decline is controversial. Selective survival between early life, when education is typically completed, and late life, when cognitive ageing studies take place, could attenuate effect estimates. Methods: We quantified potential survival bias (collider-stratification bias) in estimation of the effect of education on late-life cognitive decline by simulating hypothetical cohorts of 20-year-olds and applying cumulative mortality from US life tables. For each of four causal scenarios (2000 replications each), we compared the estimated versus causal effect of education on cognitive decline over 9 years, starting at age 60, 75 or 90 in random samples of n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2000 people who survived to each age. Results: Effects of education on cognitive decline were underestimated when both education and U, another determinant of cognitive decline, influenced mortality (colliderstratification bias). The magnitude of bias was sensitive to the magnitude of the effect of U on cognitive decline and whether there was a multiplicative interaction between education and U on mortality. For example, when there was a multiplicative interaction between education and U on mortality, 95\% confidence interval coverage of the causal effect ranged from 83.4\% to 50.4\% at age 60 and 25.8\% to 0.2\% at age 90. Conclusions: Selective survival could lead to underestimation of effects of education on late-life cognitive decline. Our simulations map survival bias to testable assumptions about underlying causal structures.},

The effectiveness of these implementation strategies is often context-dependent and reconciling the desire to produce generalizable knowledge in the face of these contextual interventions is a central challenge for implementation science researchers. Methods: We provide an overview of the causal transportability theory and conceptualize context under this framework. We review how causal graphs can be used to illustrate the assumptions necessary to apply the results of a study to a new context, and we illustrate this approach using an example of a community adherence group intervention that aims to improve retention in HIV care. Finally, we discuss several key insights highlighted by the transportability theory that are relevant to implementation science researchers. Results: By adopting causal transportability to consider how context may affect the success of an implementation strategy, researchers can formally diagnose when the results of a study are likely to generalize to a given setting. Moreover, selection diagrams can highlight what additional measurements would be needed in a target population to estimate the effect of an implementation strategy in that target population without having to repeat the initial study. Conclusions: Transportability translates intuition about contextdependent interventions and external validity into actionable and testable insight.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Pragmatic randomized trials are important tools for shared decision-making, but no guidance exists on patients' preferences for types of causal information. We aimed to assess preferences of patients and investigators toward causal effects in pragmatic randomized trials. Study Design and Setting: We (a) held three focus groups with patients (n 5 23) in Boston, MA; (b) surveyed (n 5 12) and interviewed (n 5 5) investigators with experience conducting pragmatic trials; and (c) conducted a systematic literature review of pragmatic trials (n 5 63). Results: Patients were distrustful of new-to-market medications unless substantially more effective than existing choices, preferred stratified absolute risks, and valued adherence-adjusted analyses when they expected to adhere. Investigators wanted both intention-totreat and per-protocol effects but felt methods for estimating per-protocol effects were lacking. When estimating per-protocol effects, many pragmatic trials used inappropriate methods to adjust for adherence and loss to follow-up. Conclusion: We made four recommendations for pragmatic trials to improve patient centeredness: (1) focus on superiority in effectiveness or safety, rather than noninferiority; (2) involve patients in specifying a priori subgroups; (3) report absolute measures of risk; and (4) complement intention-to-treat effect estimates with valid per-protocol effect estimates. \'O 2018 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Background: The extent to which individual statins vary in terms of clinical outcomes across all populations, in addition to secondary and primary prevention has not been studied extensively in meta-analyses. Methods: We systematically studied 199,721 participants in 92 placebo-controlled and active-comparator trials comparing atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin in participants with, or at risk of developing, cardiovascular disease. We performed pairwise and network meta-analyses for major coronary events and all-cause mortality outcomes, taking into account the dose differences across trials. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO 2011:CRD42011001470. Results: There were only a few trials that evaluated fluvastatin. Most frequent comparisons occurred between pravastatin and placebo, atorvastatin and placebo, and rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. No trial directly compared all six statins to each other. Across all populations, statins were significantly more effective than control in reducing all-cause mortality (OR 0.87, 95\% credible interval 0.82\textendash 0.92) and major coronary events (OR 0.69, 95\% CI 0.64\textendash 0.75). In terms of reducing major coronary events, atorvastatin (OR 0.66, 95\% CI 0.48\textendash 0.94) and fluvastatin (OR 0.59, 95\% CI 0.36\textendash 0.95) were significantly more effective than rosuvastatin at comparable doses. In participants with cardiovascular disease, statins significantly reduced deaths (OR 0.82, 95\% CI 0.75\textendash 0.90) and major coronary events (OR 0.69, 95\% CI 0.62\textendash 0.77). Atorvastatin was significantly more effective than pravastatin (OR 0.65, 95\% CI 0.43\textendash 0.99) and simvastatin (OR 0.68, 95\% CI 0.38\textendash 0.98) for secondary prevention of major coronary events. In primary prevention, statins significantly reduced deaths (OR 0.91, 95\% CI 0.83\textendash 0.99) and major coronary events (OR 0.69, 95\% CI 0.61\textendash 0.79) with no differences among individual statins. Across all populations, atorvastatin (80\%), fluvastatin (79\%), and simvastatin (62\%) had the highest overall probability of being the best treatment in terms of both outcomes. Higher doses of atorvastatin and fluvastatin had the highest number of significant differences in preventing major coronary events compared with other statins. No significant heterogeneity or inconsistency was detected. Conclusions: Statins significantly reduce the incidence of all-cause mortality and major coronary events as compared to control in both secondary and primary prevention. This analysis provides evidence for potential differences between individual statins, which are not fully explained by their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-reducing effects. The observed differences between statins should be investigated in future prospective studies.},

  abstract = {Background and purpose Both stroke and obesity show an increasing incidence worldwide. While obesity is an established risk factor for stroke, its influence on outcome in ischemic stroke is less clear. Many studies suggest a better prognosis in obese patients after stroke (``obesity paradox''). This review aims at assessing the clinical outcomes of obese patients after stroke by performing a systematic literature search. Methods The reviewers searched MEDLINE from inception to December 2015. Studies were eligible if they included outcome comparisons in stroke patients with allocation to body weight. Results Twenty-five studies (299'750 patients) were included and none was randomised. Ten of 12 studies (162'921 patients) reported significantly less mortality rates in stroke patients with higher BMI values. Seven of 9 studies (92'718 patients) ascertained a favorable effect of excess body weight on non-fatal outcomes (good clinical outcome, recurrence of vascular events). Six studies (85'042 patients) indicated contradictory results after intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), however. Several methodological limitations were observed in major part of studies (observational study design, inaccuracy of BMI in reflecting obesity, lacking body weight measurement, selection bias, survival bias). Conclusion Most observational data indicate a survival benefit of obese patients after stroke, but a number of methodological concerns exist. No obesity paradox was observed in patients after IVT. There is a need for well-designed randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of weight reduction on stroke risk in obese patients.},

Sufficient causes are sometimes used to deepen potential-outcome explanations of this phenomenon. In doing so, care should be taken to avoid tipping the balance between simplification and realism too far toward simplification. Death and other competing risks should not be assumed away. The time scale should be explicit, with specific times for the occurrence of specified component causes and for the completion of each sufficient cause. Component causes that affect risk should occur no later than the start of the risk period. Sufficient causes should be allowed to have component causes in common. When individuals experience all components of two or more sufficient causes, the outcome must be recurrent. In addition to effects on rates and risks, effects on incidence time itself should be considered.},

Here, our objective was to systematically review, synthesize and critique the epidemiological literature that examines the relationship between statin use and cognition, so as to assess the current state of knowledge, identify gaps in our understanding, and make recommendations for future research. We summarize the findings of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, grouped according to study design. We discuss the methods for each, and consider likely sources of bias, such as reverse causation and confounding. Although observational studies that considered statin use at or near the time of dementia diagnosis suggest a protective effect of statins, these findings could be attributable to reverse causation. RCTs and well-conducted observational studies of baseline statin use and subsequent cognition over several years of follow-up do not support a causal preventative effect of late-life statin use on cognitive decline or dementia. Given that much of the human research on statins and cognition in the future will be observational, careful study design and analysis will be essential.},

Subjects: A subset of 2584 subjects sequentially recruited from among the 4396 participants aged 65-74 in the trial of treatment of hypertension in older adults.

Outcome measures: The rate of change in paired associate learning test (PALT) and trail making test part A (TMT) scores (administered at entry and at 1, 9, 21, and 54 months) over time. Results: There was no difference in the mean learning test coefficients (rate of change of score over time) between the three treatments: diuretic -0.31 (95\% confidence interval -0.23 to -0.39), {$\beta$} blocker -0.33 (-0.25 to -0.41), placebo -0.30, (-0.24 to -0.36).

This study aimed to determine whether blood pressure lowering would reduce the risks of dementia and cognitive decline among individuals with cerebrovascular disease.The Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 6105 people with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack. Participants were assigned to either active treatment (perindopril for all participants and indapamide for those with neither an indication for nor a contraindication to a diuretic) or matching placebo(s). The primary outcomes for these analyses were dementia (using DSM-IV criteria) and cognitive decline (a decline of 3 or more points in the Mini-Mental State Examination score).During a mean follow-up of 3.9 years, dementia was documented in 193 (6.3\%) of the 3051 randomized participants in the actively treated group and 217 (7.1\%) of the 3054 randomized participants in the placebo group (relative risk reduction, 12\% [95\% confidence interval, -8\% to 28\%]; P = .2). Cognitive decline occurred in 9.1\% of the actively treated group and 11.0\% of the placebo group (risk reduction, 19\% [95\% confidence interval, 4\% to 32\%]; P = .01). The risks of the composite outcomes of dementia with recurrent stroke and of cognitive decline with recurrent stroke were reduced by 34\% (95\% confidence interval, 3\% to 55\%) (P = .03) and 45\% (95\% confidence interval, 21\% to 61\%) (P\&lt;.001), respectively, with no clear effect on either dementia or cognitive decline in the absence of recurrent stroke.Active treatment was associated with reduced risks of dementia and cognitive decline associated with recurrent stroke. These findings further support the recommendation that blood pressure lowering with perindopril and indapamide therapy be considered for all patients with cerebrovascular disease.Arch Intern Med. 2003;163:1069-1075--{$>$}}

  abstract = {In observational cohort mortality studies with prolonged periods of exposure to the agent under study, it is not uncommon for risk factors for death to be determinants of subsequent exposure. For instance, in occupational mortality studies date of termination of employment is both a determinant of future exposure (since terminated individuals receive no further exposure) and an independent risk factor for death (since disabled individuals tend to leave empioyment). When current risk factor status determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure, standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative exposure may underestimate the true effect of exposure on mortality whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This observation raises the question, which if any population parameters can be given a causal interpretation in observational mortality studies? In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the identification and computation of causal parameters in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. This approach is shown to be equivalent to an approach in which the observational study is identified with a hypothetical double-blind randomized trial in which data on each subject's assigned treatment protocol has been erased from the data tile. Causal inferences can then be made by comparing mortality as a function of treatment protocol, since, in a double-blind randomized trial missing data on treatment protocol, the association of mortality with treatment protocol can still be estimated.},

We used data from 4930 individuals, aged 55\textendash 80 years, with no prior history of stroke, dementia or cognitive impairment, followed for 15 years within the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort. We defined the following sustained interventions on SBP: (1) maintaining SBP below 120 mmHg, (2) maintaining SBP below 140 mmHg, (3) reducing SBP by 10\% if above 140 mmHg, (4) reducing SBP by 20\% if above 140 mmHg, and a combined intervention of quitting smoking with each of these SBP-lowering strategies. We considered incident stroke and incident dementia diagnoses as outcomes. We applied the parametric g-formula to adjust for baseline and time-varying confounding. The observed 15-year risk for stroke was 10.7\%. Compared to no specified intervention (i.e., the ``natural course''), all interventions that involved reducing SBP were associated with a stroke risk reduction of about 10\% (e.g., reducing SBP by 20\% if above 140 mmHg risk ratio: 0.89; 95\% CI 0.76, 1). Jointly intervening on SBP and smoking status further decreased the risk of stroke (e.g., risk ratio: 0.83; 95\% CI 0.71, 0.94). None of the specified interventions were associated with a substantive change in dementia risk. Our study suggests that a joint intervention on SBP and smoking cessation during later life may reduce stroke risk, while the potential for reducing dementia risk were not observed.},

We validated our design by comparing our results for vascular outcomes with the effects established in large randomized trials. The study was based on the United Kingdom Health Improvement Network database that includes the computerized medical records of over four and a half million patients. RESULTS People who initiated treatment with a statin (n = 129 288) were compared with a matched sample of 600 241 people who did not initiate treatment, with a median follow-up period of 4.4 years. Statin use was not associated with an effect on a wide range of outcomes, including infections, fractures, venous thromboembolism, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, or on specific eye, neurological or autoimmune diseases. A protective effect against dementia was observed (hazard ratio 0.80, 99\% confidence interval 0.68, 0.95). There was no effect on the risk of cancer even after Ն8 years of follow-up. The effect sizes for statins on vascular end-points and mortality were comparable to those observed in large randomized trials, suggesting bias and confounding had been well controlled for. CONCLUSIONS We found little evidence to support wide-ranging effects of statins on health outcomes beyond their established beneficial effect on vascular disease.},

Individuals enrolling in the randomized controlled trial testing two anti-inflammatory agents for primary prevention of AD (Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial; ADAPT) were allowed the elective use of statins. Our objective was to assess whether statin use is associated with reduced risk of incident AD among ADAPT participants. In primary ADAPT study , participants were assessed annually for cholesterol levels and cognitive status. If impairment in cognition was noted, a dementia evaluation was performed. Onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD was taken as the date of this evaluation. Time-to-onset was analyzed in six-month intervals following enrollment. Without knowledge of primary treatment assignment in ADAPT, participants were grouped by their self-reported use of lipid-lowering agents (LLA). In the current ancillary ADAPT study we found that elective statin use was associated with significantly reduced risk of incident AD after adjustment for age, gender, education and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype. The findings were similar when comparing all LLA use (statin and non-statin LLA) to non-LLA use. Cholesterol levels were lower among statin users compared with non-LLA users, but the MMSE scores were equivalent. The data suggest that statin therapy may be of benefit in reducing the risk of AD.},

Setting Community residents of a largely urban region of South East Scotland. Participants Four hundred and seventy-eight survivors of the 1932 Scottish Mental Health Survey (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 87 498) without dementia. Measurements The Moray House Test (MHT) of intelligence administered at age 11 and age 80 years. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score, history of disease and current prescribed medications age 80 years. Results After adjusting for sex, neuroactive drugs had a detrimental effect on life long cognitive change age (F {$\frac{1}{4}$} 12.2, p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.001, partial eta-squared {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.026), statins a beneficial effect (F {$\frac{1}{4}$} 5.78, p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.017, partial eta-squared {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.013) and polypharmacy a detrimental effect (F {$\frac{1}{4}$} 6.46, p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.011, partial eta-squared {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.014). In the optimal model estimated marginal means revealed: a relative improvement for statin users, IQ age 11 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 93.2 (95\% CI 87.9\textendash 98.4) and age 80 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 100.6 (95\% CI 95.3\textendash 105.9); compared with non-users, IQ age 11 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 100.9 (95\% CI 99.4\textendash 102.3) and age 80 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 100.0 (95\% CI 98.6\textendash 101.5). Conclusions Clinically, the degree to which drugs impair cognition in relatively fit, older people may not be apparent. However, in population terms, medication use, particularly polypharmacy, is important. Statins, used as currently indicated for cardiovascular disease, appear promising in ameliorating cognitive decline in older people. However, firm recommendation of their use should await the outcome of ongoing randomised clinical trials. Copyright \# 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Purpose The decision whether to continue antidepressant use for depression during pregnancy requires weighing maternal and child risks and benefits. Little is known about the effectiveness of antidepressant therapy during pregnancy. The goal of this study is to evaluate whether standard administrative claims data can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of antidepressants. Methods Using prescription and healthcare visit Medicaid claims (2000\textendash 2007), we identified 28 493 women with a depression diagnosis and antidepressant fill in the 90 days before their last menstrual period. Antidepressant continuation was defined based on prescription fills during the first trimester. Depression hospitalizations and deliberate self-harm served as measures of the effectiveness of treatment continuation during pregnancy. Propensity score and instrumental variable analyses were used to attempt to account for confounding. Results Relative to women who discontinued antidepressant therapy, women who continued were more likely to have a depression inpatient stay (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2, 95\% confidence interval [95\%CI]: 2.0\textendash 2.4) and deliberate self-harm code (OR = 1.4, 95\%CI: 0.7\textendash 2.7). Accounting for measured covariates in the propensity score analysis, including age, race, comorbidities, comedications, features of the depression diagnosis, and antidepressant class, led to slightly attenuated estimates (OR = 2.0, 95\%CI: 1.8\textendash 2.2; OR = 1.1, 95\%CI: 0.5\textendash 2.4). Similar associations were estimated in subgroups with different levels of baseline depression severity. Proposed preference-time, calendar-time-based, and geography-based instruments were unlikely to meet the required conditions for a valid analysis. Conclusions Our findings suggest that either antidepressant medications do not reduce the risk of depression relapse in pregnant women, or that administrative data alone could not be used to validly estimate the effectiveness of psychotropic medications during pregnancy.

  abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) studies are often described as naturally occurring randomized trials in which genetic factors are randomly assigned by nature. Conceptualizing MR studies as randomized trials has profound implications for their design, conduct, reporting, and interpretation. For example, analytic practices that are discouraged in randomized trials should also be discouraged in MR studies. Here, we deconstruct the oft-made analogy between MR and randomized trials. We describe four key threats to the analogy between MR studies and randomized trials: (1) exchangeability is not guaranteed; (2) time zero (and therefore the time for setting eligibility criteria) is unclear; (3) the treatment assignment is often measured with error; and (4) adherence is poorly defined. By precisely defining the causal effects being estimated, we underscore that MR estimates are often vaguely analogous to perprotocol effects in randomized trials, and that current MR methods for estimating analogues of per-protocol effects could be biased in practice. We conclude that the analogy between randomized trials and MR studies provides further perspective on both the strengths and the limitations of MR studies as currently implemented, as well as future directions for MR methodology development and application. In particular, the analogy highlights potential future directions for some MR studies to produce more interpretable and informative numerical estimates.},

  abstract = {Background: Previously reported associations between statin use and incident dementia or cognitive decline have been inconsistent. We report the results from a 3-year prospective study on the association of statin use on cognitive decline and incident dementia in elderly African Americans. Methods: A community-based cohort of 1,146 African Americans aged 70 and older living in Indianapolis, Indiana, was evaluated in 2001 and 2004. The instrument used for cognitive assessment was the Community Screening Interview for Dementia (CSI-D). Cognitive decline was defined as CSI-D scores measured at 2001 minus scores at 2004. Measurements of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were obtained from baseline blood samples. Results: Adjusting for age at baseline, gender, education, and the possession of ApoE ␧4 allele, baseline statin use was associated with less cognitive decline (p ϭ 0.0177). There were no significant interactions of statin use when LDL-C and CRP were included. Logistic regression with the four independent variables showed that statin use may be associated with a reduction in incident dementia (OR ϭ 0.32; p ϭ 0.0673). Association with cognitive decline was less clear when investigating statin use over time. Significance remained only for those who discontinued prior to follow-up compared to continuous users or users who started after baseline. Conclusions: The relationship between statin use and cognitive decline is complex and subjected to unknown confounders. This effect may not be associated with the cholesterol lowering or antiinflammatory action of statins. Neurology\textregistered{} 2007;69:1873\textendash 1880},

The probability that Yi will exceed a preassigned t is called the i-th net survival probability. The results of a survival experiment are represented by kI "crude" survival functions, empirical counterparts of the probabilities Qi(t) that an animal will survive at least up to the age t and eventually die from Ri. The analysis of a survival experiment aims at estimating the k net survival probabilities using the empirical data on those termed crude. Theorems 1 and 2 establish the relationship between the net and the crude probabilities of survival. In particular, Theorem 2 shows that, without the not directly verifiable assumption that in their joint distribution the variables Y1, Y2, **, kare mutually independent, a given set of crude survival probabilities Qi(t) does not identify the corresponding net probabilities. An example shows that the results of a customary method of analysis, based on the assumption that Yi, Y2, ., Ykare independent, may have no resemblance to reality.},

When adjustment is made for socioeconomic status early in a person's life, we discuss under what contexts the regression coefficients for race can be interpreted as corresponding to the extent to which a racial inequality would remain if various socioeconomic distributions early in life across racial groups could be equalized. When adjustment is also made for adult socioeconomic status, we note how the overall racial inequality can be decomposed into the portion that would be eliminated by equalizing adult socioeconomic status across racial groups and the portion of the inequality that would remain even if adult socioeconomic status across racial groups were equalized. We also discuss a stronger interpretation of the effect of race (stronger in terms of assumptions) involving the joint effects of race-associated physical phenotype (eg, skin color), parental physical phenotype, genetic background, and cultural context when such variables are thought to be hypothetically manipulable and if adequate control for confounding were possible. We discuss some of the challenges with such an interpretation. Further discussion is given as to how the use of selected populations in examining racial disparities can additionally complicate the interpretation of the effects.},

In contrast, population-based studies consistently find an inverse link between cancer and dementia, that is patients with dementia having a lower risk of subsequently developing cancer, and cancer patients being less often diagnosed with dementia. Different biological processes such as inversely activated cell proliferation and survival pathways have been suggested to have an important role underlying this inverse association. However, the effect of methodological biases including surveillance or survival bias has not been completely ruled out, calling into question the inverse direction of the association between cancer and dementia. In fact, emerging evidence now suggests that cancer and dementia might share a positive association. This narrative review summarises the current literature on cancer, cognitive problems and dementia. Moreover, different strategies will be discussed to reduce the impact of potential methodological biases on the association between cancer and dementia, trying to reveal the true direction of this link.},

A particular methodological challenge in observational studies is to estimate the unbiased effect of a time-varying exposure in presence of time-varying confounders, if those confounders are affected by prior exposure. In such cases, the parametric g-formula can be applied to estimate an unbiased effect. We applied the parametric g-formula to estimate the 18-years (1994\textendash 2012) cumulative stroke risk under different scenarios of hypothetical interventions on levels of blood pressure, cholesterol, weight, physical activity, smoking and alcohol intake; and compared these to the observed scenario, to calculate the population risk ratios and risk differences. Among 14,796 eligible participants in the prospective, population-based Troms\o{} study (baseline mean age 46.1 years, 51\% women), the observed 18-years stroke risk was 5.9\%. A feasible joint hypothetical intervention on six lifestyle and metabolic risk factors would reduce the 18-year stroke risk by 32\% (95\% confidence interval 16, 44). A combination of more intensive interventions reduced the estimated 18-years stroke risk by 64\% (95\% confidence interval 40, 80). Blood pressure reduction and quitting smoking significantly reduced the risk when applied separately.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities prospective population-based cohort study enrolled 4761 participants during midlife (visit 1, 1987-1989) and followed-up over 6 visits through 2016-2017 (visit 6). BP was examined over 24 years at 5 in-person visits between visits 1 and 5 (2011-2013). During visits 5 and 6, participants underwent detailed neurocognitive evaluation. The setting was 4 US communities: Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Follow-up ended on December 31, 2017. EXPOSURES Five groups based on longitudinal patterns of normotension, hypertension ({$>$}140/90 mm Hg), and hypotension ({$<$}90/60 mm Hg) at visits 1 to 5. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was dementia onset after visit 5, based on Ascertain Dementia-8 informant questionnaires, Six-Item Screener telephone assessments, hospital discharge and death certificate codes, and the visit 6 neurocognitive evaluation. Secondary outcome was mild cognitive impairment at visit 6, based on the neurocognitive evaluation. RESULTS Among 4761 participants (2821 [59\%] women; 979 [21\%] black race; visit 5 mean [SD] age, 75 [5] years; visit 1 mean age range, 44-66 years; visit 5 mean age range, 66-90 years), there were 516 (11\%) incident dementia cases between visits 5 and 6. The dementia incidence rate for participants with normotension in midlife (n = 833) and late life was 1.31 (95\% CI, 1.00-1.72 per 100 person-years); for midlife normotension and late-life hypertension (n = 1559), 1.99 (95\% CI, 1.69-2.32 per 100 person-years); for midlife and late-life hypertension (n = 1030), 2.83 (95\% CI, 2.40-3.35 per 100 person-years); for midlife normotension and late-life hypotension (n = 927), 2.07 (95\% CI, 1.68-2.54 per 100 person-years); and for midlife hypertension and late-life hypotension (n = 389), 4.26 (95\% CI, 3.40-5.32 per 100 person-years). Participants in the midlife and late-life hypertension group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.49 [95\% CI, 1.06-2.08]) and in the midlife hypertension and late-life hypotension group (HR, 1.62 [95\% CI, 1.11-2.37]) had significantly increased risk of subsequent dementia compared with those who remained normotensive. Irrespective of late-life BP, sustained hypertension in midlife was associated with dementia risk (HR, 1.41 [95\% CI, 1.17-1.71]). Compared with those who were normotensive in midlife and late life, only participants with midlife hypertension and late-life hypotension had higher risk of mild cognitive impairment (37 affected individuals (odds ratio, 1.65 [95\% CI, 1.01-2.69]). There was no significant association of BP patterns with late-life cognitive change. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this community-based cohort with long-term follow-up, sustained hypertension in midlife to late life and a pattern of midlife hypertension and late-life hypotension, compared with midlife and late-life normal BP, were associated with increased risk for subsequent dementia.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of intensive blood pressure control on risk of dementia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial conducted at 102 sites in the United States and Puerto Rico among adults aged 50 years or older with hypertension but without diabetes or history of stroke. Randomization began on November 8, 2010. The trial was stopped early for benefit on its primary outcome (a composite of cardiovascular events) and all-cause mortality on August 20, 2015. The final date for follow-up of cognitive outcomes was July 22, 2018. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to a systolic blood pressure goal of either less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment group; n = 4678) or less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment group; n = 4683). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary cognitive outcome was occurrence of adjudicated probable dementia. Secondary cognitive outcomes included adjudicated mild cognitive impairment and a composite outcome of mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia. RESULTS Among 9361 randomized participants (mean age, 67.9 years; 3332 women [35.6\%]), 8563 (91.5\%) completed at least 1 follow-up cognitive assessment. The median intervention period was 3.34 years. During a total median follow-up of 5.11 years, adjudicated probable dementia occurred in 149 participants in the intensive treatment group vs 176 in the standard treatment group (7.2 vs 8.6 cases per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.67-1.04). Intensive BP control significantly reduced the risk of mild cognitive impairment (14.6 vs 18.3 cases per 1000 person-years; HR, 0.81; 95\% CI, 0.69-0.95) and the combined rate of mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia (20.2 vs 24.1 cases per 1000 person-years; HR, 0.85; 95\% CI, 0.74-0.97). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among ambulatory adults with hypertension, treating to a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 120 mm Hg compared with a goal of less than 140 mm Hg did not result in a significant reduction in the risk of probable dementia. Because of early study termination and fewer than expected cases of dementia, the study may have been underpowered for this end point.},

  abstract = {Background: Statins are a class of medications that reduce cholesterol by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. Whether statins can benefit patients with dementia remains unclear because of conflicting results. We hypothesized that some of the confusion in the literature might arise from differences in efficacy of different statins. We used a large database to compare the action of several different statins to investigate whether some statins might be differentially associated with a reduction in the incidence of dementia and Parkinson's disease. Methods: We analyzed data from the decision support system of the US Veterans Affairs database, which contains diagnostic, medication and demographic information on 4.5 million subjects. The association of lovastatin, simvastatin and atorvastatin with dementia was examined with Cox proportional hazard models for subjects taking statins compared with subjects taking cardiovascular medications other than statins, after adjusting for covariates associated with dementia or Parkinson's disease. Results: We observed that simvastatin is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of dementia in subjects {$\geq$}65 years, using any of three models. The first model incorporated adjustment for age, the second model included adjusted for three known risk factors for dementia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease or diabetes, and the third model incorporated adjustment for the Charlson index, which is an index that provides a broad assessment of chronic disease. Data were obtained for over 700000 subjects taking simvastatin and over 50000 subjects taking atorvastatin who were aged {$>$}64 years. Using model 3, the hazard ratio for incident dementia for simvastatin and atorvastatin are 0.46 (CI 0.44\textendash 0.48, p {$<$} 0.0001) and 0.91 (CI 0.80\textendash 1.02, p = 0.11), respectively. Lovastatin was not associated with a reduction in the incidence of dementia. Simvastatin also exhibited a reduced hazard ratio for newly acquired Parkinson's disease (HR 0.51, CI 0.4\textendash 0.55, p {$<$} 0.0001). Conclusion: Simvastatin is associated with a strong reduction in the incidence of dementia and Parkinson's disease, whereas atorvastatin is associated with a modest reduction in incident dementia and Parkinson's disease, which shows only a trend towards significance.},

Data Source/Study Setting Patients with end-stage renal disease from the US Renal Data System who had congestive heart failure or ischemic heart disease and were undergoing hemodialysis in outpatient dialysis facilities between 2006 and 2010. Study Design We explicitly emulated a target trial of three ?erythropoietin dosing strategies (aimed at achieving a low, middle, or high hematocrit) and estimated the observational analog of the per-protocol effect. Results Of 156,945 eligible patients, 41,970 died during the 18-month follow-up. Compared to the low-hematocrit strategy, the estimated risk of death was 4.6 (95\% CI 4.4?4.9) percentage points higher under the high-hematocrit strategy and 1.8 (95\% CI 1.7?1.9) percentage points higher under the mid-hematocrit strategy. The corresponding risk differences for a composite outcome of death and myocardial infarction were similar. Conclusion An explicit emulation of a target trial using electronic health records, combined with the parametric g-formula, allowed comparison of real-world dynamic strategies that have not been compared in randomized trials.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The neurocognitive effect of statins in older adults remain uncertain. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of statin use with cognitive decline and incident dementia among older adults. METHODS This analysis included 18,846 participants \$65 years of age in a randomized trial of aspirin, who had no prior cardiovascular events, major physical disability, or dementia initially and were followed for 4.7 years. Outcome measures included incident dementia and its subclassifications (probable Alzheimer's disease, mixed presentations); mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and its subclassifications (MCI consistent with Alzheimer's disease, other MCI); and changes in domain-specific cognition, including global cognition, memory, language and executive function, psychomotor speed, and the composite of these domains. Associations of baseline statin use versus nonuse with dementia and MCI outcomes were examined using Cox proportional hazards models and with cognitive change using linear mixed-effects models, adjusting for potential confounders. The impact of statin lipophilicity on these associations was further examined, and effect modifiers were identified. RESULTS Statin use versus nonuse was not associated with dementia, MCI, or their subclassifications or with changes in cognitive function scores over time (p {$>$} 0.05 for all). No differences were found in any outcomes between hydrophilic and lipophilic statin users. Baseline neurocognitive ability was an effect modifier for the associations of statins with dementia (p for interaction {$<$} 0.001) and memory change (p for interaction {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.02). CONCLUSIONS In adults \$65 years of age, statin therapy was not associated with incident dementia, MCI, or declines in individual cognition domains. These findings await confirmation from ongoing randomized trials. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2021;77:3145\textendash 56) \textcopyright{} 2021 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},
